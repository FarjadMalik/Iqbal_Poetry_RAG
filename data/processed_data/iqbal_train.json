It is not only an expression of his grief on this sad incident but is also an expression of the philosophy of life and death and the grief created by them. It expands the thoughts expressed in Poem No. 82 Falsafah-i-Gham (The Philosophy of Grief). In spite of realizing that everything in the universe is subject to the Will and Command of God the news of his mother\u2019s death was too hard to bear. He reminisces his whole life and recapitulates some memorable events of his domestic life. He explains with several examples , that death is a transitory phase in existence and is not designed to annihilate a person. The last verse of stanza 8 is important. By comparing man with stars he presents the Islamic concept of man\u2019s superiority over the rest of creation. The last two verses of stanza 10 are important. Though time mitigates all grief the loss of his mother has caused him so much grief that time cannot reduce it. The poem ends in a supplication to God for his mother.","themes":["stature","also","qudsis"],"poem":"Every particle of the universe is a prisoner of destiny | Prudence is a cover for helplessness and compulsion\nThe sky, the sun and the moon all are helpless | The fast moving stars are compelled to moving\nBreaking is the end of flower bud\u2019s pitcher in the garden | The garden\u2019s verdure and flowers are also compelled to grow\nIt may be nightingale\u2019s song or conscience\u2019 silent call | Everything is chained in the same universal chain!\nWhen this secret of helplessness becomes evident to the eye | The turbulent flood of tears in the heart dries up\nThe dance of pleasure and grief does not remain in the human heart | The song remains but the pleasure of treble and bass does not remain\nKnowledge and wisdom are robbers of tears and sighs\u2019 wealth | That is the intelligent heart is a piece of diamond!\nThough the dew\u2019s freshness does not exist in my garden | My eye is not enriched with the red tears\nAh!

It is not only an expression of his grief on this sad incident but is also an expression of the philosophy of life and death and the grief created by them. It expands the thoughts expressed in Poem No. 82 Falsafah-i-Gham (The Philosophy of Grief). In spite of realizing that everything in the universe is subject to the Will and Command of God the news of his mother\u2019s death was too hard to bear. He reminisces his whole life and recapitulates some memorable events of his domestic life. He explains with several examples , that death is a transitory phase in existence and is not designed to annihilate a person. The last verse of stanza 8 is important. By comparing man with stars he presents the Islamic concept of man\u2019s superiority over the rest of creation. The last two verses of stanza 10 are important. Though time mitigates all grief the loss of his mother has caused him so much grief that time cannot reduce it. The poem ends in a supplication to God for his mother.'"}

One was \u2018Allamah Iqbal's deep first hand knowledge of the apparent and material prosperity and the outward courtesy of the Western people, but their moral and ethical bankruptcy. The second was the Western nations' inherent hatred for and their machinations against the Muslim world, which resulted in the latter's decline.

A few of these poems have been mentioned in the Introduction to Poem 88 \u201cShakwah\u201d (The Complaint). | The causes of the fall of the Muslim Ummah can be grouped into two classes, viz. the machinations of the Western world and the shortcomings of the Muslim themselves.The present poem is complementary to Shakwah. In Shakwah the \u2018Allamah complains to God for the deplorable condition of the Muslim world and society and prays for help. In the present poem he relays the response given by God to Muslims. The details of the response are generally restricted to the Muslims\u2019 own faults. These faults can be summarized as follows: | 1. Muslims have distanced themselves from the Holy Qur\u2019an, Islamic values and the norms of their ancestors, and have adopted Western norms in thought and deeds. | 2. They have given up Islamic learning. | 3. Insincere religious and political leadership has appeared. | 4. Muslims have lost the Love of God and the zeal for Tawhad. | 5.They have fallen into traditionalism | 6. They have given up activism and struggle in the cause of God and have adopted asceticism and monasticism. | 7. They have lost the urge for struggle in the cause of Islam. | 8. Muslim society is riddled with dissensions | 9. Muslims are suffering from intellectual slavery.","themes":["Kan\u2019an","Azar","Faghfur","Pen","Haidar","are","was","Ghazala","Uthman","Yusuf","Musa","temple","Rizwan","Zikrak\u201d","Kamm","Bilal","Iran","world","negligent","\u2018Arsh-i-Baran","!","Ibraham","?","Kaif","Kai","We"],"poem":"Whatever comes out of the heart is effective | It has no wings but has the power of flight\nIt has holy origins, it aims at elegance | It rises from dust, but has access to the celestial world\nMy love was seditious, rebellious and clever | My fearless wailing rent through the sky\nOn hearing it the sun said, \u201cSomewhere there is somebody!\u201d | The planets said, \u201cAt the \u2018Arsh-i-Baran there is somebody!\u201d\nThe moon was saying, \u201cNo, it is some inhabitant of the earth!\u201d | The milky way was saying, \u201cSomebody is concealed just here\u201d!\nIf someone understood my Remonstrance Rizwan did | He understood me as the Man turned out of the Paradise !\nEven angels exclaimed in surprise \u201cWhat could this voice be! | Unknown even to the \u2018Arsh\u2019s keepers what the secret could be!\nIs the mankind\u2019s reach really even to the \u2018Arsh? | Has this pinch of dust also learned flight?\nHow ignorant of good manners the earth\u2019s denizens are! | How bold and insolent these denizens of the low are!\nIs he so insolent that even angry with God he is? | Is he the same Man who once worshipped by angels was ?\nHe is the knower of Kamm and of the enigmas of Kaif | But, he is unacquainted with the secrets of modesty\nMankind are proud of the power of their rhetoric | These ignorant people are incapable of talking\u201d!\nA voice came \u201cVery pathetic is your story | Full of restless tears is your wine-measure\nYour ecstatic clamor pervaded the celestial world | How bold in speech is your Loving heart !\nYou sweetened the Remonstrance with elegant graces | You established intercourse between God and His people\nWe are inclined to Mercy, but there is no one to implore | Whom can we show the way ?

A few of these poems have been mentioned in the Introduction to Poem 88 \u201cShakwah\u201d (The Complaint). | The causes of the fall of the Muslim Ummah can be grouped into two classes, viz. the machinations of the Western world and the shortcomings of the Muslim themselves.The present poem is complementary to Shakwah. In Shakwah the \u2018Allamah complains to God for the deplorable condition of the Muslim world and society and prays for help. In the present poem he relays the response given by God to Muslims. The details of the response are generally restricted to the Muslims\u2019 own faults. These faults can be summarized as follows: | 1. Muslims have distanced themselves from the Holy Qur\u2019an, Islamic values and the norms of their ancestors, and have adopted Western norms in thought and deeds. | 2. They have given up Islamic learning. | 3. Insincere religious and political leadership has appeared. | 4. Muslims have lost the Love of God and the zeal for Tawhad. | 5.They have fallen into traditionalism | 6. They have given up activism and struggle in the cause of God and have adopted asceticism and monasticism. | 7. They have lost the urge for struggle in the cause of Islam. | 8. Muslim society is riddled with dissensions | 9. Muslims are suffering from intellectual slavery.'"}

| In its world are two hundred paradises of colour;\nits dazzling shows have burned down abodes, | consumed with fire branch, leaf and nest.\nIts exterior is shining and captivating | but its heart is weak, a slave to the gaze;\nthe eye beholds, the heart staggers within | and falls headlong before this idol-temple.\nNo man knows what the East's destiny may be; | what is to be done with the heart bound to the exterior?\nAbdali\nWhat is able to control the East's destiny | is the unbending resolve of Pahlavi and Nadir:\nPahlavi, that heir to the throne of Qubad | whose nail has resolved the knot of Iran,\nand Nadir, that sum-capital of the Durranis | who has given order to the Afghan nation.\nDistressed on account of the Faith and Fatherland | his armies came forth from the mountains:\nat once soldier, officer and Emir | steel with his enemies, silk with his friends\nlet me be ransom for him who has seen his self | and has weighed well the present age!\nThe Westerners can have their magic tricks; | to rely on other than oneself is infidelity.\nThe Martyr - King\nSpeak again of the Indians and of India | one blade of her grass no garden can outmatch;\nspeak of her in whose mosques the tumult has died, | of her in whose temples the fire is quenched,\nof her for whose sake I gave my blood, | whose memory I have nursed in my soul.\nFrom my grief you may guess at her grief; | alas, for the beloved who knows no more the lover!\nZinda-Rud\nThe Indians reject the statutes of Europe, | they are immune to Europe's magic charms;\nalien laws are a heavy burden on the soul | even though they descend from heaven itself.\nThe Martyr-King\nHow man grows from a handful of dust | with a heart, and with desire in that heart!\nHis concern is to taste the delight of rebellion, | not to behold anything but himself;\nfor without rebellion the self is unattainable, | and while the self is not attained, defeat is inevitable.\nYou have visited my city and my land, | you have rubbed your eyes upon my tomb;\nyou who know the limits of all creation, | in Deccan have you seen any trace of life?\nZinda-Rud\nI scattered the seeds of my tears in Deccan; | tulips are growing from the soil of that garden;\nthe river Cauvery unceasing on its journey - | in its soul I have beheld a new commotion.\nThe Martyr-King\nYou who have been endowed with heart-illumining words, | I burn still with the fever of your tears.\nThe incessant digging of the nails of the initiates | has opened a river of blood from the veins of the lute.\nThat melody which issues out of your soul | imparts to every breast an inward fire.\nI was in the presence of the Lord of All, | without whom no path can be traversed;\nthough there none may dare to speak, | and the spirit's only occupation is to behold,\nI was afire with the ardour of your verses | and some of your thoughts came on my tongue.\nHe said, \"Whose is this verse which you recited?

It is the first expression of his thoughts based on his experiences in Europe. The ghazal covers several of his favorite themes. There was a time when, as a result of the knowledge spreading from Islamic Spain, Europe was starting to be freed from the theocracy of the Roman Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire, which had kept Europe enslaved in bondage of ignorance for centuries. Europe was beginning to benefit from the Reformation and Industrial Revolution. New discoveries in material sciences as well as metaphysics were beginning to show promise that Europe would benefit ethically from the blessings of knowledge. \u2018Allamah Iqbal also was somewhat impressed by this situation as is reflected by verses 1\u20113 and 10. He also got some hope of the renaissance of the Muslim world as a result of the new general awakening, as is expressed in verses 4 and 5. However, he was not completely dazed by the apparent material progress of Europe, and tempered his earlier expressed optimism with the material of verses 7\u20119 and 12. The rest of the ghazal briefly talks about some of the Islamic values which have been repeatedly preached by him. These are: | (i) The supremacy of the Heart over Intellect (verse 11).

{"poem_id":"001_106","book_title":"Bang-e-Dara","section_title":"Poems of Period - 1908-30","description":"Though the decline of the Muslim world and society can be traced back to the replacement of Khilafah-i- Rashidah by the monarchist rule of special dynasties, the last three hundred years have seen the constant fall of the Muslim world, which reached its lowest ebb after the first World War. The latter period witnessed the crumbling down of the last vestiges of the Khilafah and the complete fragmentation and subjugation of the Muslim world by its perpetual adversaries in the Western world. | This deplorable state of affairs touched the hearts of many Muslim intellectuals all over the world, including the Indian sub-continent. These intellectuals started probing into the causes of the decline of Muslims and attempted to devise means of stopping and reversing it. Though these thinkers were richly endowed with Islamic learning and were fully aware of the virtues and blessings of Islam they were unaware of the poisons in the Western thought and society which damaged Muslim society most. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, helped by the unique combination of the deep and profound knowledge of Islam as well as that of the world affairs and Western learning, stands out prominently among Muslim reformers as the one fully conversant with the strengths as well as the weaknesses of the Muslim world. The achievements of the Muslim world in all fields during the first eight centuries of the Islamic era and its ascendancy over Europe are well known. This was the result of some qualities and virtues of the Muslims of those times. When the downfall of the Muslim world started it proceeded unabated till only very recent years when the tide appeared to be turning. Determination of the causes of this degeneration is the sine qua non for Islamic renaissance. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, true to the epithet of Hakam-i-Millat (the Millat\u2019s sage or physician) spent the major part of his genius in investigating the causes of this downfall and in creating the consciousness of the situation in the Muslim mind. In addition to the damage caused by the machinations of the West the Muslim world suffered from their own increasing back-sliding from their original high spiritual, moral and ethical pedestal. The \u2018Allamah took great pains to elaborate these causes in the hope that the Muslim society would use them as the springboard for their revival. Though these thoughts are spread over this entire works in the form of poems and individual verses three long poems in Bang-i-Dara have detailed them. These poems are the present one, \u201cSham\u2018a-o-Sha\u2018ir \u201d (The Candle and the Poet) and \u201cJawab-i-Shakwah\u201d (The Response to the Complaint), also in the same book. The present poem is a complaint to God in which \u2018Allamah Iqbal describes the sacrifices made by the Muslim Ummah in the cause of Islam, as well as their achievements. He pleads that in view of this the present deplorable condition of the Muslim world is unfair. He prays for Divine help to Muslims to improve their condition and get back their old status of prestige and glory. | Though several reputed thinkers and literateurs in the Indian sub-continent and other parts of the Muslim world had earlier attempted to probe into the causes and suggest remedial and corrective measures for the poor condition of the Muslim Ummah \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s two poems, viz Shakwah (The Complaint) and Jawab-i-Shakwah (The Response to the Complaint) stand out as the ones with exquisite literary grandeur and beauty. For this reason it was but natural for them to have special appeal to all Muslims in general and to the Muslims of the Indian sub-continent in particular. The poems did have this effect and made \u2018Allamah Iqbal near and dear to the hearts of the Muslims everywhere. These poems have been translated and molded into music in Urdu as well as other languages including Arabic and important European languages.","themes":["Kalimah","Yazdan","sellers","Faran","Salman","Ahad","ocean","Saljuqs","Hu!","Sasanas","still","poppies","Qur\u2019an","Ayaz","Bilal","Sulaiman","Qaisar\u2019s","me","Turanas","huda","lamp","Khaibar","unfaithful"],"poem":"Why should I be destructive and remain reckless of betterment? | Think not of the future, remain occupied in today\u2019s problems?\nShould I hear nightingale\u2019s wails, and remain completely silent? | O companion!

The latter period witnessed the crumbling down of the last vestiges of the Khilafah and the complete fragmentation and subjugation of the Muslim world by its perpetual adversaries in the Western world. | This deplorable state of affairs touched the hearts of many Muslim intellectuals all over the world, including the Indian sub-continent. These intellectuals started probing into the causes of the decline of Muslims and attempted to devise means of stopping and reversing it. Though these thinkers were richly endowed with Islamic learning and were fully aware of the virtues and blessings of Islam they were unaware of the poisons in the Western thought and society which damaged Muslim society most. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, helped by the unique combination of the deep and profound knowledge of Islam as well as that of the world affairs and Western learning, stands out prominently among Muslim reformers as the one fully conversant with the strengths as well as the weaknesses of the Muslim world. The achievements of the Muslim world in all fields during the first eight centuries of the Islamic era and its ascendancy over Europe are well known. This was the result of some qualities and virtues of the Muslims of those times. When the downfall of the Muslim world started it proceeded unabated till only very recent years when the tide appeared to be turning. Determination of the causes of this degeneration is the sine qua non for Islamic renaissance. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, true to the epithet of Hakam-i-Millat (the Millat\u2019s sage or physician) spent the major part of his genius in investigating the causes of this downfall and in creating the consciousness of the situation in the Muslim mind. In addition to the damage caused by the machinations of the West the Muslim world suffered from their own increasing back-sliding from their original high spiritual, moral and ethical pedestal. The \u2018Allamah took great pains to elaborate these causes in the hope that the Muslim society would use them as the springboard for their revival. Though these thoughts are spread over this entire works in the form of poems and individual verses three long poems in Bang-i-Dara have detailed them. These poems are the present one, \u201cSham\u2018a-o-Sha\u2018ir \u201d (The Candle and the Poet) and \u201cJawab-i-Shakwah\u201d (The Response to the Complaint), also in the same book. The present poem is a complaint to God in which \u2018Allamah Iqbal describes the sacrifices made by the Muslim Ummah in the cause of Islam, as well as their achievements. He pleads that in view of this the present deplorable condition of the Muslim world is unfair. He prays for Divine help to Muslims to improve their condition and get back their old status of prestige and glory. | Though several reputed thinkers and literateurs in the Indian sub-continent and other parts of the Muslim world had earlier attempted to probe into the causes and suggest remedial and corrective measures for the poor condition of the Muslim Ummah \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s two poems, viz Shakwah (The Complaint) and Jawab-i-Shakwah (The Response to the Complaint) stand out as the ones with exquisite literary grandeur and beauty. For this reason it was but natural for them to have special appeal to all Muslims in general and to the Muslims of the Indian sub-continent in particular. The poems did have this effect and made \u2018Allamah Iqbal near and dear to the hearts of the Muslims everywhere. These poems have been translated and molded into music in Urdu as well as other languages including Arabic and important European languages.'"}

How strange! | Our separation is separation-in-union.\nSeparation gives to this dust (i.e. man) an insight, | It gives the weight of a mountain to a straw.\nSeparation is a token of love; | It agrees with the nature of lovers.\nIf we are alive, it is due to this affliction (of separation), | And if we are immortal, it is due to it.\nWhat is \"I\" and \"He\"? It is a divine mystery | \"I\" and \"He\" are a witness to our immortality.\nThe light of the Essence is everywhere, hidden and apparent ; | To live in company is real life.\nLove does not acquire insight without company, | And without company, it does not become self-conscious.\nIn our assembly, there are divine manifestations, behold! | The world is non-existent and He is existent, behold.\nDoors and walls, cities, towns and streets are not there, | For here there is nothing existent except we and He.\nSometimes He makes Himself a stranger to us, | Sometimes He plays upon us as upon a musical instrument.\nSometimes we fashion His idol out of stone, | Sometimes we prostrate before Him without having seen Him.\nSometimes we tear every veil of Nature, | And boldly see His beautiful face.\nWhat fancy has this handful of dust? | It is due to this fancy that his inner self is illumined.\nWhat a nice fancy that he bewails in separation | And yet he grows and develops through it.\nThis separation developed in him such a spiritual insight, | That he turned his dusk into a dawn.\nHe made the ego subject to affliction: | Thus turned the ancient grief into an ever-living joy.\nHe got strings of pearls from the tears of his eyes | From the tree of bewailing he got sweet fruit.\nTo press the ego tightly to the bosom | Is to turn death into everlasting life.\nWhat is Love? It is to tie all the different stages in a knot. | What is Love? It is to pass beyond all goals.\nLove does not know of any termination, | Its dawn has no dusk.\nThere are no bends in its way as in that of intellect, | In its lustre of a moment, there is a world.\nThousands of worlds lie along our path, | How can our endeavours reach their finale?\nO traveller I live for ever and die for ever, | Take hold of the world that comes before you.\nIt is not the goal of our journey to merge ourselves in His ocean. | If you catch hold of Him, it is not fana (extinction).\nIt is impossible for an ego to be absorbed in another ego, | For the ego to be itself is its perfection.","input":"Generate a poem in the style of Allama Iqbal from the book 'Zabur-e-Ajam' best described as ''"}

The first part shows frustration and disappointment at the helplessness of ordinary men, who are without the warmth of Khuda. The second part deals with Man's inability to understand his own reality without Divine guidance. In the third part there is a hint to the poetic genius of \u2018Allamah Iqbal with which he resolves to infuse a new life in the inhabitants of India. It also shows disappointment at the political slavery of India and the state of helplessness as well as lack of struggle and planning for gaining independence. This is followed by an eloquent expression of the resolve of \u2018Allamah Iqbal to break the inaction and inertia of the Indian people. In the next two parts he deals exclusively with the ethical decline of Muslims in general and that of those of India in particular. This is followed by corrective measures in the next two parts.

The second part deals with Man's inability to understand his own reality without Divine guidance. In the third part there is a hint to the poetic genius of \u2018Allamah Iqbal with which he resolves to infuse a new life in the inhabitants of India. It also shows disappointment at the political slavery of India and the state of helplessness as well as lack of struggle and planning for gaining independence. This is followed by an eloquent expression of the resolve of \u2018Allamah Iqbal to break the inaction and inertia of the Indian people. In the next two parts he deals exclusively with the ethical decline of Muslims in general and that of those of India in particular. This is followed by corrective measures in the next two parts.

Tasawwuf is based on the inability of the human Intellect to comprehend the marvels and mysteries of the celestial and spiritual worlds. Matters like the Existence of God can be argued for and against with Intellect and logic. Its logic can be understood with the study of \"Anfus o Afaq\" to which the Holy Qur'an has repeatedly referred for this purpose. Spiritual philosophers and sufis have adjudged God as \"Wajib al-Wujud\" (the Being whose Existence is essential for the creation and operation of the universe). However, His Dhat (Essence) is incomprehensible and indescribable. For that reason the Islamic system has established ninety nine names, which are really attributes, by which we can get some feeling for His Nature, but not knowledge. `Ibadah, in the broad sense and meditation can enable a person to feel His Essence. Similarly, other spiritual objects, like Paradise and Hell are beyond human comprehension, and their nature can only be felt, rather than described. The Holy Qur'an and Hadith literatures have used highly metaphorical language so as to make the subject somewhat intelligible to the persons of average intelligence. Any other kind of description would have been intelligible to the super or ultra-intellectuals only, if at all. Furthermore, it would have led to perpetual arguments and schisms among Muslims as has happened in other religions, based on philosophies. With this in the background of his thoughts \u2018Allamah Iqbal warns us in this poem, in a sarcastic style, that literal explanations of the descriptions of spiritual objects in the Holy Qur'an and Hadith literatures on these matters can lead to gross misunderstanding, particularly in the young and immature minds. \u2018Ibadah and meditation are the only means of getting some feeling of these subjects. The following excerpt discusses resurrection and its aftermath: | \u201cThe point, however, which has caused much difference of opinion among Muslim philosophers and theologians is whether the re\u2011emergence of Man involves the re\u2011emergence of his former physical medium. Most of them, including Shah Wali Allah, the last great theologian of Islam, are inclined to think that it does involve at least some kind of physical medium suitable to the ego's new environment. It seems to me that this view is mainly due to the fact that the ego, as an individual, is inconceivable without some kind of local reference or empirical background.

What that other way is we do not know. Nor do we gain any further insight into the nature of the 'second creation' by associating it with some kind of body, however subtle it may be.

{"poem_id":"001_119","book_title":"Bang-e-Dara","section_title":"Poems of Period - 1908-30","description":"This short poem, full of pathos, is the sincere out-pouring of \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s heart-felt grief. It is an allegory of an audience with the Holy Prophet S.A.W. It is usual with \u2018Allamah Iqbal, in common with Khawajah Altaf Hussain Hala to present his feelings to the Holy Prophet (S.A.W) at critical times and to request him for supplication to God to alleviate the situation. This poem was written in 1913 for the immediate problem of the invasion of Libya by Italy, as is indicated by the last verse. However, it also reflects the \u2018Allamah\u2019s feelings on the deplorable condition of the Muslim Ummah throughout the world in the first two decades of the present century. At that time the imperialist countries of Europe were ransacking the whole world, pillaging the natural resources of the defenseless nations of all countries outside Europe. Not stopping there they obliterated the cultures and religions of the vanquished people in the misplaced enthusiasm of making them \u201ccivilized\u201d, and protecting them from hell-fire. Their strategy consisted of forcing as well as enticing them into the fold of Christianity, among other things, by their doctrine of vicarious atonement of S.\u2018Isa A.S. In case of the Muslim countries there was an added reason for enmity in their attempt to wreak vengeance of their repeated defeats at the hands of Muslims in the Wars of Crusades over a long period of time. | tarabilus (Tripoli) is a port in Tripolitania, which is the northwestern province of the present day Libya, extending from the Mediterranean to the Sahara. It was invaded and conquered by Italy in 1911-12, when it was a part of the Khilafah. | The machinations of the European imperialists against the Islamic Ummah have been documented in many books which can be consulted for details. | The bereavement of Muslims was caused not only by the conquest of Muslim countries by Europeans but by the atrocities during and after such conquests. All colonial countries have witnessed them. The following few quotations show the seriousness of the matter: | (Shakab Arsalan (1869-1946) was a Druze Muslim, who fought constantly against European powers throughout his life. - Author.) | \u201cHis (Arsalan\u2019s) commitment was most evident in his reaction to the Italian invasion of Libya in October 1911, when he went to the battle-front himself. This response although more direct than others was not unrepresentative of reverberations which the Italian invasion produced throughout the Arab Islam. In Tunisia there were open anti-Italian riots; in Egypt a strong wave of pro-Uthmaniyah sentiment swept across all levels of society. Fear of the systematic European campaign against Islam was heightened by the fact that French forces had occupied Fez in the spring of 1911, initiating the final stages in the process that added Morocco to the international system of protectorates.\u201d (p. 19) | The so-called \u201cInternational system of protectorates\u201d was the establishment of suzerainty of European powers. (Author) | \u201cIn this earlier phase, which is our concern here, Arsalan was never more outspoken than in his condemnation of General Graziani\u2019s brutalization of the Cryenaican population.

It is an allegory of an audience with the Holy Prophet S.A.W. It is usual with \u2018Allamah Iqbal, in common with Khawajah Altaf Hussain Hala to present his feelings to the Holy Prophet (S.A.W) at critical times and to request him for supplication to God to alleviate the situation. This poem was written in 1913 for the immediate problem of the invasion of Libya by Italy, as is indicated by the last verse. However, it also reflects the \u2018Allamah\u2019s feelings on the deplorable condition of the Muslim Ummah throughout the world in the first two decades of the present century. At that time the imperialist countries of Europe were ransacking the whole world, pillaging the natural resources of the defenseless nations of all countries outside Europe. Not stopping there they obliterated the cultures and religions of the vanquished people in the misplaced enthusiasm of making them \u201ccivilized\u201d, and protecting them from hell-fire. Their strategy consisted of forcing as well as enticing them into the fold of Christianity, among other things, by their doctrine of vicarious atonement of S.\u2018Isa A.S. In case of the Muslim countries there was an added reason for enmity in their attempt to wreak vengeance of their repeated defeats at the hands of Muslims in the Wars of Crusades over a long period of time. | tarabilus (Tripoli) is a port in Tripolitania, which is the northwestern province of the present day Libya, extending from the Mediterranean to the Sahara. It was invaded and conquered by Italy in 1911-12, when it was a part of the Khilafah. | The machinations of the European imperialists against the Islamic Ummah have been documented in many books which can be consulted for details. | The bereavement of Muslims was caused not only by the conquest of Muslim countries by Europeans but by the atrocities during and after such conquests. All colonial countries have witnessed them. The following few quotations show the seriousness of the matter: | (Shakab Arsalan (1869-1946) was a Druze Muslim, who fought constantly against European powers throughout his life. - Author.) | \u201cHis (Arsalan\u2019s) commitment was most evident in his reaction to the Italian invasion of Libya in October 1911, when he went to the battle-front himself. This response although more direct than others was not unrepresentative of reverberations which the Italian invasion produced throughout the Arab Islam. In Tunisia there were open anti-Italian riots; in Egypt a strong wave of pro-Uthmaniyah sentiment swept across all levels of society. Fear of the systematic European campaign against Islam was heightened by the fact that French forces had occupied Fez in the spring of 1911, initiating the final stages in the process that added Morocco to the international system of protectorates.\u201d (p. 19) | The so-called \u201cInternational system of protectorates\u201d was the establishment of suzerainty of European powers. (Author) | \u201cIn this earlier phase, which is our concern here, Arsalan was never more outspoken than in his condemnation of General Graziani\u2019s brutalization of the Cryenaican population. He wrote to Rida that when he learnt of the deportations, executions, tortures and sexual humiliations inflicted on the civilian population of Jabal al- Akhzar \u201cI let my pen loose on those dogs\u201d.

In fact, he did not want to escape life and its problems but fight against them. This was his most important message and advice to all his readers, and particularly to Muslims.

What is this\nThere is a lamp within your heart; | What is this light which is in your mirror?\nDon't be negligent, you are its trustee, | What folly that you do not look within your self!","input":"Generate a poem in the style of Allama Iqbal from the book 'Zabur-e-Ajam' best described as ''"}

As explained in the introduction to that poem this series of poems deals with the rise, glory, achievements, decline and fall of the Muslim world. As stated earlier this subject was the one dearest to \u2018Allamah Iqbal and perhaps the raison d`etre of his works. In Shakwah the emphasis is on the services and achievements of the early Muslims in the cause of Islam and God. In the present poem the field has widened. The poem is an allegory describing a conversation with the candle. The poet himself represents an average Muslim leader, spiritual as well as secular. He starts with asking the candle the reason for its effectiveness in creating its love in the moth and the one for his own ineptitude in the field of influencing his own circle. The candle states the reason to be its own sincerity and the lack of it in the leaders. The main cause of the present deplorable condition of the Muslim Ummah is its distancing itself from the Holy Qur\u2019an and Islamic values. The recent efforts at reform are inadequate as well as too late. However, like other works of \u2018Allamah Iqbal, in this poem also the state of his frustration is not permanent. The candle gives the message of hope and points out that the Muslim Ummah is waking up to its responsibilities and is starting to face its adversaries with the help of the Holy Qur\u2019an. The great potential of the Ummah is described in detail and the poem ends with firm hope and promise of success for the Ummah and defeat of our enemies and their value system.

{"poem_id":"001_018","book_title":"Bang-e-Dara","section_title":"Before 1908","description":"The ordinary candle is a world unto itself in Persian and Urdu literatures. It is taken as an emblem of a beloved as well as that of a lover. As a beloved the moth circles round it and eventually dies in its love. As a lover it is presented as weeping in the agony of separation from its beloved. In this poem \u2018Allamah Iqbal has equated candle with Man as both are afflicted with the agony of separation from the Creator and Beloved, i.e. God. There is, however, one difference. Man is endowed with \"feeling\", which raises him above the candle and, in fact, above all creation. This quality is a part of the attribute of Khuda 1 which has entitled Man to be endowed with knowledge, on account of which God has ranked him as the masterpiece of creation and His vicegerent on earth (The Holy Qur'an 2:30-34). Endowed with this attribute Man was transferred from Paradise to earth to witness the Jamal and Jalal of God as conveyed by the kaleidoscope of His creation and as communicated to Man through his qualities of knowledge and perception. However, this world is the temporary abode of Man and he has been charged with the mission of maintaining its beauty and protecting it from disturbances in the physical as well as spiritual spheres. To attain this goal he has been charged with the responsibility of struggling for the establishment of the Kingdom of God on earth. This commissioning of Man has been repeated at several places in the Holy Qur'an, reference to which has been provided previously. | The `Allamah says in this poem that the possession of \"feeling\" has endowed Man with compassion which is a very elegant quality. However, deceptive perception has made Man a captive of discrimination of race and color, which has resulted in his losing the joy of the universal peace which can be achieved only through the acknowledgment of the Universal Unity of God as well as that of Man and Love of both.","themes":["roof","Diwan","Tajalli\u2019s","rue","being","am","homeland","denizens","restless","Cognizance","Candle!","tears","Love","witness","again","Secret's"],"poem":"O Candle!

It is taken as an emblem of a beloved as well as that of a lover. As a beloved the moth circles round it and eventually dies in its love. As a lover it is presented as weeping in the agony of separation from its beloved. In this poem \u2018Allamah Iqbal has equated candle with Man as both are afflicted with the agony of separation from the Creator and Beloved, i.e. God. There is, however, one difference. Man is endowed with \"feeling\", which raises him above the candle and, in fact, above all creation. This quality is a part of the attribute of Khuda 1 which has entitled Man to be endowed with knowledge, on account of which God has ranked him as the masterpiece of creation and His vicegerent on earth (The Holy Qur'an 2:30-34). Endowed with this attribute Man was transferred from Paradise to earth to witness the Jamal and Jalal of God as conveyed by the kaleidoscope of His creation and as communicated to Man through his qualities of knowledge and perception. However, this world is the temporary abode of Man and he has been charged with the mission of maintaining its beauty and protecting it from disturbances in the physical as well as spiritual spheres. To attain this goal he has been charged with the responsibility of struggling for the establishment of the Kingdom of God on earth. This commissioning of Man has been repeated at several places in the Holy Qur'an, reference to which has been provided previously. | The `Allamah says in this poem that the possession of \"feeling\" has endowed Man with compassion which is a very elegant quality. However, deceptive perception has made Man a captive of discrimination of race and color, which has resulted in his losing the joy of the universal peace which can be achieved only through the acknowledgment of the Universal Unity of God as well as that of Man and Love of both.'"}

Later he moved to Bijapur and lived under the patronage of Ibraham \u2018Adil Shah. He was one of the eminent Persian poets of his time. In addition to the inclusion of one verse in the last two verses of this poem \u2018Allamah Iqbal has alluded to this verse in Rumuz-i-Bekhudi also. Mullah \u2018Abd al-Qadir Badayuni also has praised this verse in his book Muntakhib al-Tawarakh. | This poem is the exposition of \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s views on Western education. Though the educational philosophy of \u2018Allamah Iqbal is a vast subject and much has been written about it, its essence is that education should produce Khuda and the desire as well as the ability to struggle in the cause of God and Truth. Though the subject cannot be explained in all its dimensions in this translation some comprehension is essential to do justice to the poem. Western education may be beneficial to the Western people and may have been necessary for the material advancement of Indian Muslims in their special circumstances created by the British rule in the sub-continent it is detrimental to the ideals and goals of Islam as set out in the Holy Qur\u2019an. Establishment of the \u201cKingdom of God on earth\u201d in the form of the super-national Islamic State, with all its details and accompaniments, is the purpose of the mission of the Holy Prophet (S.A.W.), which was entrusted by him to his Ummah at the time of the last pilgrimage. The Holy Qur\u2019an is replete with commands to this effect, reference to which has been made in previous poems, for example the introduction to Poem 84. Taranah-i-Milla (The National Anthem of Muslims). When viewed against this background Western education not only falls short of the needs of Muslims but is contrary to them. Being secular and materialistic it is in fact detrimental to Muslims\u2019 aspirations and objectives. A small sample of quotations from some other poems of \u2018Allamah Iqbal is given below to give some indication of his views on the subject: | (209) The school and tavern teach only not to be | Learn to be that you may be and want to be | (210) O God !

When Sir Saiyyid Ahmad Khan and his colleagues started their campaign to persuade Indian sub-continent\u2019s Muslims to acquire Western education they had scientific and technical education foremost in mind. \u2018Allamah Iqbal had the same opinion and has repeatedly emphasized the importance of science and technology for material betterment. Cf. | (212) West\u2019s strength is in science and technology | With help of this same fire its lamp is lighted | The deleterious effects of Western education have resulted mainly from the philosophy of science and from humanities. The former has created a disbelief in the existence of a non-tangible spiritual universe, and has created belief in the mechanistic and a-rational concept of creation and operation of the material universe. This is opposed to the Qur\u2019anic concept according to which the material universe has been created by God instead of coming into existence by accident. It has been created with a purpose and not whimsically or in sport. It also states that the material universe in not eternal and will also end in its present form. The Holy Qur\u2019an is replete with this message which emphasizes its importance, e.g. 3:191; 15:85; 16:3; 21:16-17; 39:5; 44:39; 45:22; and 46:73. The Holy Qur\u2019an also teaches us that God has not rested or retired after creating the universe but is actively directing its affairs. Denial of this concept deprives Man of faith in the life Hereafter and the accountability for one\u2019s deeds on earth. This deprivation leads to the cardinal vice of materialism according to which this world and life in it is the be-all and end-all of existence. This inculcates jealousy and greed for acquiring material wealth and arrogance when it has been acquired. This triple-headed monster of jealousy, greed and arrogance brings out a plethora of vices out of the Pandora\u2019s box. One has to look around himself in the present day world to appreciate the truth of this.

These two religions are diametrically opposed to each other in these two respects. In the \u2018Allamah\u2019s view the second emanates from the first and is more important. Hinduism is an amalgam of traditions and rituals, of devotional and philosophical systems, built over the past 4500 years, arising from the indigenous Dravidian cults and successive invasions from outside, especially those of Aryans (2000-1500 B.C.). The oldest existing religious book of Hindus is the Vedas (Ca. 500 B.C.). In the context of this poem the Hindu society is traditionally divided into four classes or castes. viz. (i) Brahman (priests) (ii) Khashtrya (noble warriors) (iii) Vaishya (merchants and farmers) and (iv) Shudra (workers). The last mentioned are also untouchables. This abominable system of dividing humanity into four separate and completely immiscible classes is against the teachings of Islam (The Holy Qur\u2019an 49:13) and this forms the subject matter of this poem. Its evils are described in the poem. However, the \u2018Allamah also pays tribute to two other religious reformers of the Indian sub-continent, viz. Gautam Buddha and Nanak. The first protest against the caste system came from Siddharta Gautam Buddha. Buddha\u2019s rejection of the caste system and declaration that all humanity is one is dealt with in this poem. The second reform came in the 16th century in the form of Sikhism founded by Guru Nanak. This religion was a movement for reformation of Hinduism under the strong influence of Islam.

| What does it mean to \"give the soul away\"?\nTo give away the soul is to surrender it to God, | it means melting the mountain with the soul's flame.\n\"Drunk with vision\" means discovering one's self, | shining like a star in the night-season:\nnot to discover one's self is not to exist, | to discover is to bestow the self on the Self.\nWhosoever has seen himself and has seen naught else | has drawn forth the load from the self's prison;\nthe \"drunk with vision\" who beholds himself | deems the sting sweeter than the honey\nin his eyes the soul is cheap as the air, | before him the walls of his prison tremble;\nhis axe shivers the granite rock | so that he takes his share of the universe.\nWhen he gives up the soul, his soul is truly his, | otherwise his soul is his guest but for a moment or two.\nZinda- Rud\nYou have spoken of the wisdom of foul and fair; | learned sage, expound a further subtlety.\nYou were the guide of those who behold the inner meanings | you were the confidant of the secrets of kings.\nWe are poor men, and the ruler demands tribute; | what is the origin of the sanction of throne and crown?\nShah-i Hamadan\nWhat is the origin of Kingship in East and West? | Either the consent of the peoples, or war and violence.\nExalted sir, I will speak with you plainly; | it is forbidden to pay tribute save to two persons:\neither those in authority as being among you, | whose proof and demonstration is the verse of God,\nor else a hero swift-rising like a hurricane | who seizes cities, and stakes himself in the battle,\non the day of war conquering the land by force of arms, | on the day of peace by the winning ways of love.\nYou might indeed purchase Iran and India, | but kingship cannot be bought from any man;\nvirtuous friend, the Cup of Jamshid | none shall procure from the glassmaker's shop,\nor if he procures aught, all he owns is glass, | and glass has no other property but to break.\nGhani\nWho gave to India this yearning for freedom? | Who gave the quarry this passion to be the hunter?\nThose scions of Brahmins, with vibrant hearts, | whose glowing cheeks put the red tulip to shame\nkeen of eye, mature and strenuous in action | whose very glance puts Europe into commotion.\nTheir origin is from this protesting soil of ours, | the rising-place of these stars is our Kashmir.\nIf you suppose our earth is without a spark, | cast a glance for a moment within your heart;\nwhence comes all this ardour you possess, | whence comes this breath of the breeze of spring?\nIt is from the selfsame wind's influence | that our mountains derive their colour and scent.\nDo you not know what one day a wave | said to another wave in Lake Wular?\nHow long shall we strike at each other in this sea? | Rise up, let us break together against the shore.\nOur child, that is to say, yon ancient river | fills with its roar valley and mountains and meadow;\ncontinually it smites the rocks on its path | until it uproots the fabric of the mountains.\nThat youth who seized cities, deserts and plains | took his nurture from the milk of a hundred mothers;\nits majesty strikes terror into mortal hearts; | all this is from us, not from any other.\nTo live in the bounds of the shore is a sin; | our shore is but a stone in our path.\nTo accommodate oneself to the shore is eternal death, | even though you roll in the sea morning and evening;\nlife is to leap amidst mountain and desert | happy is the wave that has transgressed the shore!\nYou who have read the lines on the brow of Life, | you who have given to the East the tumult of Life,\nyou who have a sigh that consumes the heart, | stirring you to restlessness, and us still more,\nfrom you the birds in the meadow learned their threnody, | in your tears the grasses make ablution;\nout of your genius the field of roses blossomed, | out of your hope many souls are filled with hope.\nYour cry is a bell urging the caravans; | why then do you despair of the dwellers in the Vale?\nTheir hearts are not dead in their breasts, | their embers are not extinguished under the ice;\nwait till you see, without the sound of the Trumpet, | a nation rising out of the dust of the tomb.\nDo not grieve then, visionary; | breathe out that sigh consuming all, dry and moist alike;\nmany cities beneath the turquoise heaven | have been consumed by the flame of a dervish heart.\nDominion is frailer than a bubble | and can be destroyed by a single. breath.\nThe destinies of nations have been shaped by a song, | by a song nations are destroyed and rebuilt.\nThough your lancet has pierced men's hearts, | none has perceived you as you truly are;\nyour melody springs from a poet's song, | but what you utter transcends poesy.\nStir up a new tumult in Paradise, | strike up an intoxicating air in Paradise!\nZinda- Rud\nHabituate yourself to the dervish wine and quaff it continuously; | when you become riper, hurl yourself at the dominion of Jamshid.\nThey said, \"This world of ours-does it agree with you?\" | I said, \"It does not agree\". They said, \"Then break it to pieces\".\nIn the taverns I have seen there is not one worthy adversary; | grapple with Rustam-i Dastan, have done with Magian boys!\nTulip of the wilderness, you cannot burn alone; | strike this heart- enflaming brand upon the breast of man;\nYou are the ardour of his bosom, the heat of his blood | do you not believe me? Then tear apart the flesh of the world.\nIs reason your lamp? Set it on the path to shine; | or is love your cup?

Stars are the units or building blocks of the universe. They are marvels of the creation of God. The history of astronomy shows that the marvels and mysteries of the universe have always baffled mankind. The greatest marvel of the universe is it\u2019s organization and the coherence of the celestial bodies which constitute it. This is created by the mutual attraction of stars or gravity divinely conferred upon them. \u2018Allamah Iqbal has frequently alluded to this phenomenon in his works, often as a lesson to the Muslim Ummah to acquire the virtue of mutual love among it\u2019s constituents to create and maintain the coherence and continuity of the Islamic society. | Just as the universe is a coherent and well-organized entity the Holy Qur\u2019an , which is another marvel of the creation of God, is also a masterpiece of logical order of it\u2019s constituents. Though the Holy Qur\u2019an was revealed to the Holy Prophet S.A.W. over a period of 23 years, it\u2019s compilation and organization in the present form was done by the Holy Prophet S.A.W. himself under Divine guidance. Comprehensive overview of the Holy Qur\u2019an shows that its surahs (chapters) and ayat (verses) within the surahs are not haphazardly arranged as alleged by Islam\u2019s enemies due to ignorance or prejudice. Indeed these parts follow a distinct logical order, which is more helpful to it\u2019s study than chronological order, which is often suggested by western scholars. | \u2018Allamah \u2018Abd Allah Yusuf \u2018Ala has very ably shown this orderly arrangement as well as it\u2019s logic in his Introduction to the relevant surahs. He has recognized 14 groups of surahs and has shown how these groups are arranged in a logical sequence and how the surahs in each group are similarly arranged. These groups are ; Surahs 1-7; 8-16; 17-21; 22-25; 26-28; 29-32; 33; 34-39; 40-46; 47-49; 50-56; 57-66; 67-94; and 95-114. Perusal of Introductions to the first surah of each group clarifies the above assertion. In addition to these groups certain surahs are arranged in pairs. In such surahs the continuation of the subject matter is shown or suggested by a cue-word, e.g. surahs 33-34, 45-46, 52-53. | The poem under study alludes to the last of the three pairs referred to above. In these surahs the continuity is shown by the word \u201cstar\u201d in the last verse of surah 52 corresponding to \u201cstars\u201d in the first verse of surah 53. Consequently, this pair of surahs is called \u201cZahrawatain\u201d or \u201cThe Two Bright Ones\u201d. The central theme of surah 52 (Al-tur or The Mount) is that the Revelation of the Holy Qur\u2019an, as that of the previous scriptures, is in accord with all the signs of God, and that the here-after is irresistible and we must prepare for it. The theme of Surah 53 (Al-Najm or The Star) is that as God is the source of all things, including Revelation, the latter is not an illusion. Illusion is in the minds of those with weak or no Iman. The central theme of these two surahs is expressed in the poem\u2019s last verse, i.e. the destruction of the universe in it\u2019s present form is inevitable and that all those existing in this universe in company will separate and will be severally responsible for their deeds. It will also be noticed that the subject matter of this poem and the previous one is continuous. | In a later edition of Bang-i-Dara the first hemistich of the first verse is written with the vowel sign, kasrah or zer, in the third word, reading it as \u201cqiran\u201d, meaning \u201cconjunction of stars\u201d. If this reading is adopted the meaning and message of the poem still remains as related above, with emphasis on the last paragraph of the same. There will be a little change in the translation of the first verse which should read as follows: | As two stars appeared in the Qiran together | One started saying to the other | However, in this case the stated meaning is far-fetched and indirect, for which reason I would prefer the first version, i.e. \u201cQur\u2019an\u201d.","themes":["!","sky"],"poem":"As two stars came together in the Holy Qur\u2019an | One started saying this to the other\n\u201cHow excellent if this union together be permanent | How excellent if the end be walking together\nIf the sky becomes slightly favorable | We two will be with similar glow\u201d\nBut this longing for the union proved | Completely a message of the end of the union\nRevolution is the destiny of the stars | For each its special orbit is fixed\nThe permanence of union is a mere dream | The rule of the universe is separation !","input":"Generate a poem in the style of Allama Iqbal from the book 'Bang-e-Dara' best described as 'This and the previous poem, named \u201cStar\u201d are complementary to each other.

It is based on an imaginary conversation with S. Khizar A.S. on the model of that described in the Holy Qur\u2019an 18:60-82. The artistic perfection of the poet has made the parallel perfect. S. Musa A.S. was guided through wahy to search for S. Khizar A.S. for obtaining eternal secrets. The Holy Qur\u2019an uses the expression Majma\u2018 al- Bahrain for the meeting of the two, which may mean confluence of two seas or two rivers. The consensus of opinion among exegesists is that this place was the Gulf of Aqabah. However, \u2018Allamah Abu al-A\u2018la Mawduda has expressed the opinion that the meeting place could have been at the junction of the two tributaries of the River Nile, the \u201cBahr-al-Abyaz\u201d (The White Nile) and \u201cBahr-al-Arzaq\u201d (The Blue Nile) in Sudan. Bahr also means a large river which agrees with the word Darya used in this poem. However, irrespective of the meeting place the poem describes the questions posed by \u2018Allamah Iqbal in the first part and the answers he received in subsequent parts. These are clear and self contained in the poem. It is also a commentary on World War I and its influence on the Western as well as the Muslim world.","themes":["\u201cpolitics\u201d","Samira","scissors","Azar\u2019s","Badakhshan","melted","cap","m\u00e0miya\u2019a","age","soul","Isra\u2019al","Adam","Khizar","Truth","wall\u201d","ornaments","yukhlif-ul-Ma\u2019ad\u201d","eye","Arab","dawn","Ayaz","Sulaiman","Qaisar\u2019s","salamander","al-muluk\u201d","Alexander","Ibraham\u2019s","again","life","me","boat\u201d","Mahmud","strength","fikan\u201d","blood","Essence","?","Alamut","foundation!","Kashghar","Namrud","Salsabal","beware"],"poem":"One night at the river-bank I was absorbed in contemplation | With a world of restlessness concealed in the heart\u2019s recesses\nThe night was tranquil, air calm, river gently flowing was | My eye was amazed whether the river or a picture of water it was!\nAs the suckling baby falls asleep in the cradle | The restless wave had fallen asleep somewhere else!\nWith the spell of night the birds were confined in nests | The twinkling stars were caught in the moon\u2019s spell!\nSuddenly I saw that the globe-trotting Khizar | Whose old age contained youth\u2019s color like dawn\nWas saying to me \u201cO seeker of the eternal secrets | If the inner eye be open world\u2019s destiny would be unveiled\u201d!\nOn hearing this an uproaring tumult rose in my heart | Being devoted to seeking the Truth I started talking thus\n\u201cO you whose world-encompassing eye sees those storms | Whose tumults are still sleeping quietly in the river\nThe \u201cindigent\u2019s boat\u201d the chaste soul , the \u201corphan\u2019s wall\u201d | Even the knowledge of Musa before you is in amazement\nLeaving habitations you remain wandering in wilderness | No day and night, no yesterday and tomorrow is in your life\nWhat is the secret of life?

{"poem_id":"001_014","book_title":"Bang-e-Dara","section_title":"Before 1908","description":"This poem, though simple in language, is charged with mystic thought. As this is the first poem of its kind in this book and many more will follow it appears appropriate to clarify a few points. The commonplace phenomena of \"Gul-O-Bulbul \" (the association of the flower and the nightingale), and \"Sham`-o-Parwanah\" (the candle and the moth) have always been symbolic of the lover-beloved relationship in Persian and Urdu poetry. However, much of this poetry has long been conventional and poems have been evaluated on the basis of their linguistic beauty, innovative expressions and elegance of style without paying much attention to the subject matter or the depth of thought expressed in the poem. | Poetry is a spontaneous expression of human emotions. The most important human emotion is love, both of the material form and that of the innate qualities of the beloved. Pre-Islamic poetry was usually amorous. Wine with its accompaniments of the cup, the goblet, the decanter, the cup bearer and the tavern were commonly used. Though this practice prevailed in all literatures it was most predominant in the pre-Islamic Arabic poetry. Exaggeration was a very common and much liked attribute of poets and poetry. For that reason the Holy Qur'an frowned at poets (26:224-26). However, it should be remembered that the above verse does not amount to outright condemnation of all poets and all poetry, but is only a passing remark on the aspect of misleading others by exaggeration. Reference to the Holy Qur\u2019an 26:221-24 would clarify this statement. | The world is heavily indebted to Islam and Muslims for metamorphosing romantic poetry and sublimating it from amorous love to that of Divine Love. God, the Holy Prophet S.A.W. and his descendants became the \"beloved\" instead of human forms. Thus, mundane, albeit natural, human emotion was sublimated into pure and angelic form. Acts of worship became changed from mere rituals to submission to the Will of God and fear motivated exercises became sublimated to those of the Love of the highest order (The Holy Qur\u2019an 41:37). New forms of poetry, like \"hamd\", \"na\u2018t\" , \"thana\" marthiah and new kinds of music, like \"qawwala \", came into existence for the expression of Man's Love for God, the Holy Prophet S.A.W. and his descendants, as well as for other heroes and heroines of Islam. | All the terminology, conventionally used in amorous poetry, like wine, cup, goblet, decanter, cup bearer and tavern acquired new meanings. In fact mysticism itself changed from a vague, esoteric, occult concept into one of concrete, systematic effort for the comprehension of the Ultimate Truth about the Existence as well as the Essence of God, based on the feelings of the heart of a true Lover of Him, rather than through dry and insipid reasoning of the philosopher. A whole technique was developed for seeking the Divine Light and for expressing human Love for the Divine Being. This technique has borne the test of the criterion of repeatability required by the scientific method. The new science acquired the name of \"Tasawwuf\" or \"Sufism\". | In this poem the poet has sublimated the proverbial love of the moth for the candle into the Love of a Mu\u2019min for God.

As this is the first poem of its kind in this book and many more will follow it appears appropriate to clarify a few points. The commonplace phenomena of \"Gul-O-Bulbul \" (the association of the flower and the nightingale), and \"Sham`-o-Parwanah\" (the candle and the moth) have always been symbolic of the lover-beloved relationship in Persian and Urdu poetry. However, much of this poetry has long been conventional and poems have been evaluated on the basis of their linguistic beauty, innovative expressions and elegance of style without paying much attention to the subject matter or the depth of thought expressed in the poem. | Poetry is a spontaneous expression of human emotions. The most important human emotion is love, both of the material form and that of the innate qualities of the beloved. Pre-Islamic poetry was usually amorous. Wine with its accompaniments of the cup, the goblet, the decanter, the cup bearer and the tavern were commonly used. Though this practice prevailed in all literatures it was most predominant in the pre-Islamic Arabic poetry. Exaggeration was a very common and much liked attribute of poets and poetry. For that reason the Holy Qur'an frowned at poets (26:224-26). However, it should be remembered that the above verse does not amount to outright condemnation of all poets and all poetry, but is only a passing remark on the aspect of misleading others by exaggeration. Reference to the Holy Qur\u2019an 26:221-24 would clarify this statement. | The world is heavily indebted to Islam and Muslims for metamorphosing romantic poetry and sublimating it from amorous love to that of Divine Love. God, the Holy Prophet S.A.W. and his descendants became the \"beloved\" instead of human forms. Thus, mundane, albeit natural, human emotion was sublimated into pure and angelic form. Acts of worship became changed from mere rituals to submission to the Will of God and fear motivated exercises became sublimated to those of the Love of the highest order (The Holy Qur\u2019an 41:37). New forms of poetry, like \"hamd\", \"na\u2018t\" , \"thana\" marthiah and new kinds of music, like \"qawwala \", came into existence for the expression of Man's Love for God, the Holy Prophet S.A.W. and his descendants, as well as for other heroes and heroines of Islam. | All the terminology, conventionally used in amorous poetry, like wine, cup, goblet, decanter, cup bearer and tavern acquired new meanings. In fact mysticism itself changed from a vague, esoteric, occult concept into one of concrete, systematic effort for the comprehension of the Ultimate Truth about the Existence as well as the Essence of God, based on the feelings of the heart of a true Lover of Him, rather than through dry and insipid reasoning of the philosopher. A whole technique was developed for seeking the Divine Light and for expressing human Love for the Divine Being. This technique has borne the test of the criterion of repeatability required by the scientific method. The new science acquired the name of \"Tasawwuf\" or \"Sufism\". | In this poem the poet has sublimated the proverbial love of the moth for the candle into the Love of a Mu\u2019min for God. The poem will become full of meaning if read in this light.'"}

The last two verses indicate \u2018Allamah Iqbal's frustration which can be appreciated only by those similarly afflicted.'"}
