    "prompt": "Generate a poem in the style of Allama Iqbal from the book 'Bang-e-Dara' with the theme revolving around 'This poem belongs to the first period of ‘Allamah Iqbal's poetic and intellectual evolution, which ended at the time of his departure to Europe in 1905 for higher studies. This period is considered to be the period of ‘Allamah Iqbal's nature poetry. \"Himalah\" is the opening poem of Bang-i-Dara. It eulogizes the physical beauty and geographical importance of the Himalayan Range. Though mountains are equated with natural beauty all over the world, and the beauty of many mountain regions has been extolled by poets and other intellectuals alike, the Himalayas stand out as a shining star in the galaxy of the world's mountain ranges. | The Himalayas form an extensive mountain range which stretches across the northern side of the Indian sub-continent from Kashmar to Assam, between the valleys of the Indus and Brahamaputra Rivers. It is bout 2,400 km. long and 160-240 km. wide and joins the Karakorums and the Hindu Kush Ranges. It is the highest mountain range in the world and includes some of the world's highest peaks, viz. Everest (8,847 m.), Kanchenjunga (8,579 m.), Nanga Parbat (8,126 m.) Annapurna (8,078 m.), and Nanda Devi (7, 817 m.). | The word \"Himalaya\" is derived from the Sanskrit word \"Himachal\", meaning the \"Abode of Snow\". The name reflects the long range of permanently snow covered peaks, which are among the highest in the world and form a continuous wall of shimmering silver. Words cannot describe the beauty of this mountain range. It must be seen to be appreciated. \"A hundred divine epochs would not suffice to describe the marvels of the Himalayas\", says a Sanskrit proverb. | ‘Allamah Iqbal, a native of the Indo-Pakistan sub-continent was of Kashmar origin. Kashmar , which is a part of the Himalayan Range, and in itself is beauty par excellence, must have inspired him with a special love. However, his object in writing this poem was not merely to sing the praises of this mountain tract. Being an ‘arif, the beauty of God's countenance as reflected in His creation had become manifest to his insight. He was moved by the beauty and the grandeur of the Himalayas. To him the Himalayas were one of the innumerable master pieces of the Creative Power and Artistry of God. To him it was one of the shuhuds of God's artistry, and a way of witnessing His Tajalla-i-Sura. This feeling bursts out in verse 3. I myself had the good fortune of living and working in the sylvan beauty of the Himalayas for about twenty years of my life and of sharing the feelings of Sa‘da, when he says: | (158) The leaves of green trees in the wise man's perception | Every leaf is an encyclopedia of the Creator's cognition | Modern knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the plant leaf attests to these attributes.'",

Are you like a theater stage | Which nature's hand has made for its elements?\nAh! How the cloud is swaying in excessive joy | The cloud like an unchained elephant is speeding\nGentle movement of the morning zephyr is acting like a cradle | Every flower bud is swinging with intoxication of existence\nThe flower bud's silence with the petal's tongue is saying | \"I have never experienced the jerk of the florist's hand\nSilence itself is relating the tale of mine | The corner of nature's solitude is the abode of mine\"\nThe brook is melodiously descending from the high land | Putting the waves of Kawthar and Tasnam to embarrassment\nAs if showing the mirror to Nature's beauty | Now evading now rowing against the rock in its way\nPlay in passing this orchestra of beautiful music | O wayfarer! The heart comprehends your music\nWhen the night's Lailah unfurls her long hair | The sound of water-falls allures the heart\nThat silence of the night whose beauty surpasses speech | That state of silent meditation overshadowing the trees\nThat dusk's beauty which shivers along the mountain range | Very beautiful looks this rouge on your cheeks\nO Himalah! Do relate to us some stories of the time | When your valleys became abode of Man's ancestors\nRelate something of the life without sophistication | Which had not been stained by the rouge of sophistication\nO Imagination! Bring back that period | O Vicissitudes of Time speed backwards",

The commonplace phenomena of \"Gul-O-Bulbul \" (the association of the flower and the nightingale), and \"Sham`-o-Parwanah\" (the candle and the moth) have always been symbolic of the lover-beloved relationship in Persian and Urdu poetry. However, much of this poetry has long been conventional and poems have been evaluated on the basis of their linguistic beauty, innovative expressions and elegance of style without paying much attention to the subject matter or the depth of thought expressed in the poem. | Poetry is a spontaneous expression of human emotions. The most important human emotion is love, both of the material form and that of the innate qualities of the beloved. Pre-Islamic poetry was usually amorous. Wine with its accompaniments of the cup, the goblet, the decanter, the cup bearer and the tavern were commonly used. Though this practice prevailed in all literatures it was most predominant in the pre-Islamic Arabic poetry. Exaggeration was a very common and much liked attribute of poets and poetry. For that reason the Holy Qur'an frowned at poets (26:224-26). However, it should be remembered that the above verse does not amount to outright condemnation of all poets and all poetry, but is only a passing remark on the aspect of misleading others by exaggeration. Reference to the Holy Qur’an 26:221-24 would clarify this statement. | The world is heavily indebted to Islam and Muslims for metamorphosing romantic poetry and sublimating it from amorous love to that of Divine Love. God, the Holy Prophet S.A.W. and his descendants became the \"beloved\" instead of human forms. Thus, mundane, albeit natural, human emotion was sublimated into pure and angelic form. Acts of worship became changed from mere rituals to submission to the Will of God and fear motivated exercises became sublimated to those of the Love of the highest order (The Holy Qur’an 41:37). New forms of poetry, like \"hamd\", \"na‘t\" , \"thana\" marthiah and new kinds of music, like \"qawwala \", came into existence for the expression of Man's Love for God, the Holy Prophet S.A.W. and his descendants, as well as for other heroes and heroines of Islam. | All the terminology, conventionally used in amorous poetry, like wine, cup, goblet, decanter, cup bearer and tavern acquired new meanings. In fact mysticism itself changed from a vague, esoteric, occult concept into one of concrete, systematic effort for the comprehension of the Ultimate Truth about the Existence as well as the Essence of God, based on the feelings of the heart of a true Lover of Him, rather than through dry and insipid reasoning of the philosopher. A whole technique was developed for seeking the Divine Light and for expressing human Love for the Divine Being. This technique has borne the test of the criterion of repeatability required by the scientific method. The new science acquired the name of \"Tasawwuf\" or \"Sufism\". | In this poem the poet has sublimated the proverbial love of the moth for the candle into the Love of a Mu’min for God. The poem will become full of meaning if read in this light.'",

It is taken as an emblem of a beloved as well as that of a lover. As a beloved the moth circles round it and eventually dies in its love. As a lover it is presented as weeping in the agony of separation from its beloved. In this poem ‘Allamah Iqbal has equated candle with Man as both are afflicted with the agony of separation from the Creator and Beloved, i.e. God. There is, however, one difference. Man is endowed with \"feeling\", which raises him above the candle and, in fact, above all creation. This quality is a part of the attribute of Khuda 1 which has entitled Man to be endowed with knowledge, on account of which God has ranked him as the masterpiece of creation and His vicegerent on earth (The Holy Qur'an 2:30-34). Endowed with this attribute Man was transferred from Paradise to earth to witness the Jamal and Jalal of God as conveyed by the kaleidoscope of His creation and as communicated to Man through his qualities of knowledge and perception. However, this world is the temporary abode of Man and he has been charged with the mission of maintaining its beauty and protecting it from disturbances in the physical as well as spiritual spheres. To attain this goal he has been charged with the responsibility of struggling for the establishment of the Kingdom of God on earth. This commissioning of Man has been repeated at several places in the Holy Qur'an, reference to which has been provided previously. | The `Allamah says in this poem that the possession of \"feeling\" has endowed Man with compassion which is a very elegant quality. However, deceptive perception has made Man a captive of discrimination of race and color, which has resulted in his losing the joy of the universal peace which can be achieved only through the acknowledgment of the Universal Unity of God as well as that of Man and Love of both.'",

Sham‘a Awr Parwanah outlines the influence of Islam on transforming the pre-Islamic \"love\" in literary works, especially poetry from amorous love to the God’s Love, the love of the Holy Prophet S.A.W and his descendants and love of Man. This resulted in the appearance of the mystical poetry of Islam. This class of poetry deals with the Love of God and Love of mankind.

Secondly, he wants to bring out his own universality as far as the orbit of Islamic learning is concerned. ‘Allamah Iqbal's knowledge of and service to Islam is multi-dimensional and multi-faceted to the extent that it is difficult to say whether he was a poet, an exegesist of the Holy Qur'an, an Islamic revivalist, a philosopher, or a sufi.

This effort includes an ardent Love of God and the Holy Prophet S.A.W. Such Love would lead Man to the state of complete submission of his own will to the Will of God, to lead a life of complete devotion to God; complete self discipline and a state of the mind in which he would consider no sacrifice too great in the struggle for His Cause. For greater details attention is invited to ‘Allamah Iqbal's two books titled Asrar-i-Khuda and Rumuz-i-Bekhuda. The net result of the loss of Khuda has led the present day Man away from submission to God and towards submission to óaghut. This has resulted in greed, jealousy, arrogance and prejudice, which are Man's cardinal sins and the root of all sins, individual as well as social, national and international. | As the re-establishment and propagation of Islamic values and the struggle for the reconstruction of Islamic society, which would struggle for and establish the super-national Islamic State, was the raison d'etre of ‘Allamah Iqbal's poetry this thought abounds in his works, including the present poem. It is not sufficient to claim the Love of God verbally. This Love has to be demonstrated and proven by sacrifices in His Cause. ‘Allamah Iqbal emphasizes the need for participating in the ‘abadah in the broad sense of the term and not just personal piety and hair splitting of the intricacies of the Shara‘ah. He has forcefully emphasized throughout his works the need for the Love of God to be the motivation of all human efforts in order to make them effective as well as acceptable to God: | (172) All wisdom of Angelic World, all knowledge of Celestial World | If it cures not the maladies of the Islamic World is all but naught | (173) The midnight remembrance, meditations, the spiritual joys of yours | If they guard not your Khuda they are all but naught | The present poem gives some indication of what the true Love of God means. It shows that the highest dangers and the greatest losses in His Cause are imminent for those struggling therein and that, though they may lead to material losses and even loss of life, the result is the reward of eternal bliss, which only those can appreciate and enjoy whom God has endowed with such light (The Holy Qur'an 2:153-57).'",

Swama Ram Tarath had a very brilliant career and passed all public examinations from High School to M.A. in Mathematics in the first division. He worked in different capacities during the period 1895-99 at the American Mission High School at Sialkot and Foreman Christian College at Lahore. He also worked at the latter institution as Alexander Fellow for a short period. He soon resigned and devoted himself to the study, practice, and teaching of the Hindu Vedant philosophy. One component of it is oath of celibacy. The Swama could not keep this oath when he went to the United States for preaching. He soon returned to India without his family and died by drowning in 1906, while bathing in River Ganga at Hardwar, one of the Holy places of Hindus. It is said to be an act of atonement for his sin of marriage. | The poem pays tribute to him, calling him a drop which united with the ocean in a way similar to the union of Man on death with God, according to the Vedant philosophy. The poem also deals with the broader share of Tawhad and ardent Love of God. It explains how the secrets of the universe are disclosed to Man through this Love, which can be exercised without the intermediation of religious bureaucracy and institutions, like temple, church etc. Such institutions divide humanity into classes which discriminate against each other.

According to this theory God existed before the creation of the universe. The creation of the universe was only the appearance of the same entity in tangible forms. These forms appear different to the un‑initiated eye but to the eye with insight they are the same One God. As long as a man is not born he lives in the Presence of God, of which he is a component and which is the real object of his Love. The act of being born and sent to the earth is separation from the object of his Love, i.e. God and the source of his afflictions. Now man will remain separated from God till his death. According to this concept Man's afflictions are the products of this separation. However, they would disappear after death or if and when one has reached the stage in which he can see God in the objects of the universe, which he can achieve through real \"Ibadah\", i.e. subservience to God in the comprehensive sense enjoined by Islam.

    "prompt": "Generate a poem in the style of Allama Iqbal from the book 'Bang-e-Dara' with the theme revolving around 'This is another short poem which is highly mystical and difficult to understand. Tasawwuf is based on the inability of the human Intellect to comprehend the marvels and mysteries of the celestial and spiritual worlds. Matters like the Existence of God can be argued for and against with Intellect and logic. Its logic can be understood with the study of \"Anfus o Afaq\" to which the Holy Qur'an has repeatedly referred for this purpose. Spiritual philosophers and sufis have adjudged God as \"Wajib al-Wujud\" (the Being whose Existence is essential for the creation and operation of the universe). However, His Dhat (Essence) is incomprehensible and indescribable. For that reason the Islamic system has established ninety nine names, which are really attributes, by which we can get some feeling for His Nature, but not knowledge. `Ibadah, in the broad sense and meditation can enable a person to feel His Essence. Similarly, other spiritual objects, like Paradise and Hell are beyond human comprehension, and their nature can only be felt, rather than described. The Holy Qur'an and Hadith literatures have used highly metaphorical language so as to make the subject somewhat intelligible to the persons of average intelligence. Any other kind of description would have been intelligible to the super or ultra-intellectuals only, if at all. Furthermore, it would have led to perpetual arguments and schisms among Muslims as has happened in other religions, based on philosophies. With this in the background of his thoughts ‘Allamah Iqbal warns us in this poem, in a sarcastic style, that literal explanations of the descriptions of spiritual objects in the Holy Qur'an and Hadith literatures on these matters can lead to gross misunderstanding, particularly in the young and immature minds. ‘Ibadah and meditation are the only means of getting some feeling of these subjects. The following excerpt discusses resurrection and its aftermath: | “The point, however, which has caused much difference of opinion among Muslim philosophers and theologians is whether the re‑emergence of Man involves the re‑emergence of his former physical medium. Most of them, including Shah Wali Allah, the last great theologian of Islam, are inclined to think that it does involve at least some kind of physical medium suitable to the ego's new environment. It seems to me that this view is mainly due to the fact that the ego, as an individual, is inconceivable without some kind of local reference or empirical background. The Holy Qur'an 50:3,4 throw some light on this point. | 'What ! When dead and turned to dust, shall we rise again ? Remote is such a return'. Now know what the earth consumeth and what with us is as a book in which account is kept .’ | To my mind these verses clearly suggest that the nature of the universe is such that it is open to it to maintain in some other way the kind of individuality necessary for the final working of human action, even after the disintegration of what appears to specify his individuality in his present environment. What that other way is we do not know. Nor do we gain any further insight into the nature of the 'second creation' by associating it with some kind of body, however subtle it may be. The analogies of the Holy Qur’an only suggest it as a fact; they are not meant to reveal its nature and character. Philosophically speaking, therefore , we cannot go further than this ‑ that in view of the past history of Man it is highly improbable that his career should come to an end with the dissolution of his body. | However, according to the teaching of the Holy Qur'an the ego's re‑emergence brings him a \"sharp sight\" whereby he clearly sees his \"self‑built fate fastened round his neck\" (50:21-22) (read with 17:13). Heaven and Hell are states, not localities. The descriptions in the Holy Qur'an are visual representations of an inner fact, i.e. character. Hell, in the words of the Holy Qur’an, is ' God's kindled fire which mounts above the heart ' ! -- ­the painful realization of one's failure as a Man. Heaven is the joy of triumph over the forces of disintegration. There is no such thing as eternal damnation in Islam. The word 'eternity' used in certain verses, relating to Hell, is explained by the Holy Qur’an itself to mean only a period of time (78:23). Time cannot be wholly irrelevant to the development of personality. Character tends to become permanent; its re‑shaping must require time. Hell, therefore, as conceived by the Holy Qur’an is not a pit of everlasting torture inflicted by a revengeful God; it is a corrective experience which may make a hardened ego once more sensitive to the living breeze of Divine Grace. Nor is Heaven a holiday. Life is one and continuous. Man marches always onwards to receive ever fresh illuminations from an Infinite Reality, 'which every moment appears in a new glory'. And the recipient of Divine Illumination is not merely a passive recipient. Every act of free ego creates a new situation, and thus offers further opportunities of creative unfolding.\"'",

One was ‘Allamah Iqbal's deep first hand knowledge of the apparent and material prosperity and the outward courtesy of the Western people, but their moral and ethical bankruptcy. The second was the Western nations' inherent hatred for and their machinations against the Muslim world, which resulted in the latter's decline. These feelings attained their climax when he reached the Island of Sicily on his return journey to India. | Sicily had been conquered by the Aghlabad Dynasty of Tunisia in the early ninth century and was ruled by them as well as by other Arab dynasties till it was conquered back by the Normans in the second half of the eleventh century. This poem has resulted from the flood of thoughts which must have streamed through his mind on reaching the Island of Sicily. The sight of the island brought back to his mind the Muslim world with its glory in ethical as well as social, economic and political fields. The Muslim world, which at one time was spread over northern Africa, southern Europe, central, southern and south‑eastern Asia and was the cradle of the highest civilization of all times, and in moral and ethical spheres, was the highest power, had crumpled down by his time. This sight must have brought to his mind the whole panorama of the period of Muslim suzerainty in Africa and southern Europe. After the Norman conquest of Sicily the Muslim world and society have experienced constant decline which has continued till today. In contrast with the memory of the past glory must have passed his mind the extremely poor condition of the Muslim world in his time. This reminiscence must have made ‘Allamah Iqbal very painfully sad as is evident from the verses of this poem. | At that time little did ‘Allamah Iqbal know that the Muslim Ummah would have to go through much more afflictions than imagined at that time, till he cried out in 1924: | Rendered cheap like water is the blood of the Muslim | You are agitated as your heart is not aware of the secret | More perturbing than the affliction itself was his life‑long realization which poured out of his afflicted heart in 1935: | What an outrage, extinguished is the Love's fire | The Muslim is no more than a heap of burnt ashes !'",

There was a time when, as a result of the knowledge spreading from Islamic Spain, Europe was starting to be freed from the theocracy of the Roman Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire, which had kept Europe enslaved in bondage of ignorance for centuries. Europe was beginning to benefit from the Reformation and Industrial Revolution. New discoveries in material sciences as well as metaphysics were beginning to show promise that Europe would benefit ethically from the blessings of knowledge. ‘Allamah Iqbal also was somewhat impressed by this situation as is reflected by verses 1‑3 and 10. He also got some hope of the renaissance of the Muslim world as a result of the new general awakening, as is expressed in verses 4 and 5. However, he was not completely dazed by the apparent material progress of Europe, and tempered his earlier expressed optimism with the material of verses 7‑9 and 12. The rest of the ghazal briefly talks about some of the Islamic values which have been repeatedly preached by him. These are: | (i) The supremacy of the Heart over Intellect (verse 11). Also see Note 8 to Poem 73 \"‘Abd al‑Qadir Key Nam (Addressed to Abd al‑Qadir) and Introduction to ghazal 75‑5. | (ii) Love of humanity is of prime importance for piety and religion (verse 13). | (iii) Avoiding ostentation, and practicing perseverance and selflessness is very important in Love for God (verses 14‑16). | (iv) Expression of his own ambition for participation in the important task of struggle for Islam's revival and renaissance (verse 15).

    "prompt": "Generate a poem in the style of Allama Iqbal from the book 'Bang-e-Dara' with the theme revolving around 'This and the previous poem, named “Star” are complementary to each other. Stars are the units or building blocks of the universe. They are marvels of the creation of God. The history of astronomy shows that the marvels and mysteries of the universe have always baffled mankind. The greatest marvel of the universe is it’s organization and the coherence of the celestial bodies which constitute it. This is created by the mutual attraction of stars or gravity divinely conferred upon them. ‘Allamah Iqbal has frequently alluded to this phenomenon in his works, often as a lesson to the Muslim Ummah to acquire the virtue of mutual love among it’s constituents to create and maintain the coherence and continuity of the Islamic society. | Just as the universe is a coherent and well-organized entity the Holy Qur’an , which is another marvel of the creation of God, is also a masterpiece of logical order of it’s constituents. Though the Holy Qur’an was revealed to the Holy Prophet S.A.W. over a period of 23 years, it’s compilation and organization in the present form was done by the Holy Prophet S.A.W. himself under Divine guidance. Comprehensive overview of the Holy Qur’an shows that its surahs (chapters) and ayat (verses) within the surahs are not haphazardly arranged as alleged by Islam’s enemies due to ignorance or prejudice. Indeed these parts follow a distinct logical order, which is more helpful to it’s study than chronological order, which is often suggested by western scholars. | ‘Allamah ‘Abd Allah Yusuf ‘Ala has very ably shown this orderly arrangement as well as it’s logic in his Introduction to the relevant surahs. He has recognized 14 groups of surahs and has shown how these groups are arranged in a logical sequence and how the surahs in each group are similarly arranged. These groups are ; Surahs 1-7; 8-16; 17-21; 22-25; 26-28; 29-32; 33; 34-39; 40-46; 47-49; 50-56; 57-66; 67-94; and 95-114. Perusal of Introductions to the first surah of each group clarifies the above assertion. In addition to these groups certain surahs are arranged in pairs. In such surahs the continuation of the subject matter is shown or suggested by a cue-word, e.g. surahs 33-34, 45-46, 52-53. | The poem under study alludes to the last of the three pairs referred to above. In these surahs the continuity is shown by the word “star” in the last verse of surah 52 corresponding to “stars” in the first verse of surah 53. Consequently, this pair of surahs is called “Zahrawatain” or “The Two Bright Ones”. The central theme of surah 52 (Al-tur or The Mount) is that the Revelation of the Holy Qur’an, as that of the previous scriptures, is in accord with all the signs of God, and that the here-after is irresistible and we must prepare for it. The theme of Surah 53 (Al-Najm or The Star) is that as God is the source of all things, including Revelation, the latter is not an illusion. Illusion is in the minds of those with weak or no Iman. The central theme of these two surahs is expressed in the poem’s last verse, i.e. the destruction of the universe in it’s present form is inevitable and that all those existing in this universe in company will separate and will be severally responsible for their deeds. It will also be noticed that the subject matter of this poem and the previous one is continuous. | In a later edition of Bang-i-Dara the first hemistich of the first verse is written with the vowel sign, kasrah or zer, in the third word, reading it as “qiran”, meaning “conjunction of stars”. If this reading is adopted the meaning and message of the poem still remains as related above, with emphasis on the last paragraph of the same. There will be a little change in the translation of the first verse which should read as follows: | As two stars appeared in the Qiran together | One started saying to the other | However, in this case the stated meaning is far-fetched and indirect, for which reason I would prefer the first version, i.e. “Qur’an”.'",
    "completion": "As two stars came together in the Holy Qur’an | One started saying this to the other\n“How excellent if this union together be permanent | How excellent if the end be walking together\nIf the sky becomes slightly favorable | We two will be with similar glow”\nBut this longing for the union proved | Completely a message of the end of the union\nRevolution is the destiny of the stars | For each its special orbit is fixed\nThe permanence of union is a mere dream | The rule of the universe is separation !",

The latter period witnessed the crumbling down of the last vestiges of the Khilafah and the complete fragmentation and subjugation of the Muslim world by its perpetual adversaries in the Western world. | This deplorable state of affairs touched the hearts of many Muslim intellectuals all over the world, including the Indian sub-continent. These intellectuals started probing into the causes of the decline of Muslims and attempted to devise means of stopping and reversing it. Though these thinkers were richly endowed with Islamic learning and were fully aware of the virtues and blessings of Islam they were unaware of the poisons in the Western thought and society which damaged Muslim society most. ‘Allamah Iqbal, helped by the unique combination of the deep and profound knowledge of Islam as well as that of the world affairs and Western learning, stands out prominently among Muslim reformers as the one fully conversant with the strengths as well as the weaknesses of the Muslim world. The achievements of the Muslim world in all fields during the first eight centuries of the Islamic era and its ascendancy over Europe are well known. This was the result of some qualities and virtues of the Muslims of those times. When the downfall of the Muslim world started it proceeded unabated till only very recent years when the tide appeared to be turning. Determination of the causes of this degeneration is the sine qua non for Islamic renaissance. ‘Allamah Iqbal, true to the epithet of Hakam-i-Millat (the Millat’s sage or physician) spent the major part of his genius in investigating the causes of this downfall and in creating the consciousness of the situation in the Muslim mind. In addition to the damage caused by the machinations of the West the Muslim world suffered from their own increasing back-sliding from their original high spiritual, moral and ethical pedestal. The ‘Allamah took great pains to elaborate these causes in the hope that the Muslim society would use them as the springboard for their revival. Though these thoughts are spread over this entire works in the form of poems and individual verses three long poems in Bang-i-Dara have detailed them. These poems are the present one, “Sham‘a-o-Sha‘ir ” (The Candle and the Poet) and “Jawab-i-Shakwah” (The Response to the Complaint), also in the same book. The present poem is a complaint to God in which ‘Allamah Iqbal describes the sacrifices made by the Muslim Ummah in the cause of Islam, as well as their achievements. He pleads that in view of this the present deplorable condition of the Muslim world is unfair. He prays for Divine help to Muslims to improve their condition and get back their old status of prestige and glory. | Though several reputed thinkers and literateurs in the Indian sub-continent and other parts of the Muslim world had earlier attempted to probe into the causes and suggest remedial and corrective measures for the poor condition of the Muslim Ummah ‘Allamah Iqbal’s two poems, viz Shakwah (The Complaint) and Jawab-i-Shakwah (The Response to the Complaint) stand out as the ones with exquisite literary grandeur and beauty. For this reason it was but natural for them to have special appeal to all Muslims in general and to the Muslims of the Indian sub-continent in particular. The poems did have this effect and made ‘Allamah Iqbal near and dear to the hearts of the Muslims everywhere. These poems have been translated and molded into music in Urdu as well as other languages including Arabic and important European languages.'",

His father was Dashratha who was the king of Ayodhiyah. He had three wives, of which Rama’s mother was Kausalyah. The king exiled Rama for fourteen years to placate his other wife Kaikeyah and gave the throne to her son Bharat. Rama and his wife Sata obeyed the father’s command and went into exile. During this period they roamed about the length and breadth of the Indian sub-continent and faced the ignominy of the abduction of Sata by Ravana who was a demon and ruled Lanka (now Sri Lanka). Rama fought for a long time against Ravana and ultimately succeeded in freeing Sata from him. After this they returned to Ayodhiyah and Rama was crowned king there. | This story is related by Valmaka, an Indian ascetic and poet of the fifth century B.C. He has eulogized Rama and Sata in his well known book in Sanskrit verse, known as Ramayana. This book, is part of the Hindu mythology. Valmika in this book has deified Rama into being the seventh incarnation of Vishnu whom Hindus regard as the god of grace and who forms part of the trinity of Hindu mythology, comprised of Brahamah (the Creator), Vishnu (the preserver) and Shava (the destroyer). The belief in the divinity of Rama was stated again by another Hindu poet named Tulsa Das (1532-1623) who wrote a simpler version of Ramayana, also in verse in 1575 in the then vernacular of Sanskrit, known as Hindi. | It is interesting to know that recently a historical commission appointed by the Government of India, in connection with the controversy whether the Babra Mosque in Ayodhiyah is really on the site of Rama’s temple, has reported that there is no evidence that any man with the name of Rama ever lived in Ayodhiyah.

Today at our indigence also look\nMuslims are tightly bound in chains of sectarianism | Look at your freedom and at their bondage also look\nIn the mosque look at disintegration of the priest’s love | In the temple at the Brahman’s strong idol-worship also look\nLook at the sight of the Muslim ways in the infidels’ life | And at your Muslims’ tormenting other Muslims also look\nBe the spectator of the shower of rocks of misfortunes | At the frailty of the Muslims Ummah’s abodes also look\nYes, look at the advance flattery of the ‘honorable’ people | And at the self-respect of the formerly shameless people also look\nWhom we got acquainted with the taste of eloquence | At the haughty speech of that former speechless adversary look\nListen to sounds of pleasurable orchestra in West’s palaces | And at the preparations for the mourning in Iran also look\nThe imprudent Turk has torn the cloak of the Divine Khilafah | Look at Muslims’ simplicity at other’s cunningness also look\nLook at everything, and remain quiet like a mirror | In today tumult remain occupied in evening’s music!",

    "prompt": "Generate a poem in the style of Allama Iqbal from the book 'Bang-e-Dara' with the theme revolving around 'This is one of the series of long poems starting with poem 88, Shakwah (The Complaint). As explained in the introduction to that poem this series of poems deals with the rise, glory, achievements, decline and fall of the Muslim world. As stated earlier this subject was the one dearest to ‘Allamah Iqbal and perhaps the raison d`etre of his works. In Shakwah the emphasis is on the services and achievements of the early Muslims in the cause of Islam and God. In the present poem the field has widened. The poem is an allegory describing a conversation with the candle. The poet himself represents an average Muslim leader, spiritual as well as secular. He starts with asking the candle the reason for its effectiveness in creating its love in the moth and the one for his own ineptitude in the field of influencing his own circle. The candle states the reason to be its own sincerity and the lack of it in the leaders. The main cause of the present deplorable condition of the Muslim Ummah is its distancing itself from the Holy Qur’an and Islamic values. The recent efforts at reform are inadequate as well as too late. However, like other works of ‘Allamah Iqbal, in this poem also the state of his frustration is not permanent. The candle gives the message of hope and points out that the Muslim Ummah is waking up to its responsibilities and is starting to face its adversaries with the help of the Holy Qur’an. The great potential of the Ummah is described in detail and the poem ends with firm hope and promise of success for the Ummah and defeat of our enemies and their value system. The climax is reached in the last verse.'",

    "prompt": "Generate a poem in the style of Allama Iqbal from the book 'Bang-e-Dara' with the theme revolving around 'This short poem, full of pathos, is the sincere out-pouring of ‘Allamah Iqbal’s heart-felt grief. It is an allegory of an audience with the Holy Prophet S.A.W. It is usual with ‘Allamah Iqbal, in common with Khawajah Altaf Hussain Hala to present his feelings to the Holy Prophet (S.A.W) at critical times and to request him for supplication to God to alleviate the situation. This poem was written in 1913 for the immediate problem of the invasion of Libya by Italy, as is indicated by the last verse. However, it also reflects the ‘Allamah’s feelings on the deplorable condition of the Muslim Ummah throughout the world in the first two decades of the present century. At that time the imperialist countries of Europe were ransacking the whole world, pillaging the natural resources of the defenseless nations of all countries outside Europe. Not stopping there they obliterated the cultures and religions of the vanquished people in the misplaced enthusiasm of making them “civilized”, and protecting them from hell-fire. Their strategy consisted of forcing as well as enticing them into the fold of Christianity, among other things, by their doctrine of vicarious atonement of S.‘Isa A.S. In case of the Muslim countries there was an added reason for enmity in their attempt to wreak vengeance of their repeated defeats at the hands of Muslims in the Wars of Crusades over a long period of time. | tarabilus (Tripoli) is a port in Tripolitania, which is the northwestern province of the present day Libya, extending from the Mediterranean to the Sahara. It was invaded and conquered by Italy in 1911-12, when it was a part of the Khilafah. | The machinations of the European imperialists against the Islamic Ummah have been documented in many books which can be consulted for details. | The bereavement of Muslims was caused not only by the conquest of Muslim countries by Europeans but by the atrocities during and after such conquests. All colonial countries have witnessed them. The following few quotations show the seriousness of the matter: | (Shakab Arsalan (1869-1946) was a Druze Muslim, who fought constantly against European powers throughout his life. - Author.) | “His (Arsalan’s) commitment was most evident in his reaction to the Italian invasion of Libya in October 1911, when he went to the battle-front himself. This response although more direct than others was not unrepresentative of reverberations which the Italian invasion produced throughout the Arab Islam. In Tunisia there were open anti-Italian riots; in Egypt a strong wave of pro-Uthmaniyah sentiment swept across all levels of society. Fear of the systematic European campaign against Islam was heightened by the fact that French forces had occupied Fez in the spring of 1911, initiating the final stages in the process that added Morocco to the international system of protectorates.” (p. 19) | The so-called “International system of protectorates” was the establishment of suzerainty of European powers. (Author) | “In this earlier phase, which is our concern here, Arsalan was never more outspoken than in his condemnation of General Graziani’s brutalization of the Cryenaican population. He wrote to Rida that when he learnt of the deportations, executions, tortures and sexual humiliations inflicted on the civilian population of Jabal al- Akhzar “I let my pen loose on those dogs”. In article after article, he enumerated the horrors committed by the Italian forces and condemned Fascist Italy as being beyond the pale of humankind......... He told his readers that when the Italian forces captured the oasis of Kufrah, they turned the Great Sanusi Zawiyyah into a tavern where they drank toasts to the extermination of Muslims of Tripoli ; and they threw the Holy Qur’an’s beneath their horses’ hooves and then used them to light the fires of their cooking pots.” (p. 100). | “The Italian abuse of Islam and the population of Libya meant more than the atrocities themselves. The real objective of the Fascist government was the extermination of Islam from the entire region and replacing it with Christian colonists. Arsalan saw the Fascists in Libya acting as Ferdinand and Isabella had done toward the Moor of Spain. (pp. 100-101) | In reality one does not have to read any books to appreciate the serious nature of the situation with reference to the relationships of the Western world and their henchmen with the Islamic world. One has only to look around in the present day world to witness the heart rending atrocities of the Western nations and their proxies against the Islamic world. First sight observation is worth a million books.'",

At that time they were a formidable force and proved very effective in breaking the back bone of the Marhatas in the third battle of Panipat, near Delhi in 1761.

These two religions are diametrically opposed to each other in these two respects. In the ‘Allamah’s view the second emanates from the first and is more important. Hinduism is an amalgam of traditions and rituals, of devotional and philosophical systems, built over the past 4500 years, arising from the indigenous Dravidian cults and successive invasions from outside, especially those of Aryans (2000-1500 B.C.). The oldest existing religious book of Hindus is the Vedas (Ca. 500 B.C.). In the context of this poem the Hindu society is traditionally divided into four classes or castes. viz. (i) Brahman (priests) (ii) Khashtrya (noble warriors) (iii) Vaishya (merchants and farmers) and (iv) Shudra (workers). The last mentioned are also untouchables. This abominable system of dividing humanity into four separate and completely immiscible classes is against the teachings of Islam (The Holy Qur’an 49:13) and this forms the subject matter of this poem. Its evils are described in the poem. However, the ‘Allamah also pays tribute to two other religious reformers of the Indian sub-continent, viz. Gautam Buddha and Nanak. The first protest against the caste system came from Siddharta Gautam Buddha. Buddha’s rejection of the caste system and declaration that all humanity is one is dealt with in this poem. The second reform came in the 16th century in the form of Sikhism founded by Guru Nanak. This religion was a movement for reformation of Hinduism under the strong influence of Islam. Renunciation of the caste system is among the strongest pillars of the Sikh religion (See the last two verses of the poem).'",

    "prompt": "Generate a poem in the style of Allama Iqbal from the book 'Bang-e-Dara' with the theme revolving around 'Mullah Muhammad Malik Quma (d. 1615) came from Qum, Iran to Ahmad Nagar in South India in 1549 where he was patronized by Murtaza Niïam, Nizam Shah I. Later he moved to Bijapur and lived under the patronage of Ibraham ‘Adil Shah. He was one of the eminent Persian poets of his time. In addition to the inclusion of one verse in the last two verses of this poem ‘Allamah Iqbal has alluded to this verse in Rumuz-i-Bekhudi also. Mullah ‘Abd al-Qadir Badayuni also has praised this verse in his book Muntakhib al-Tawarakh. | This poem is the exposition of ‘Allamah Iqbal’s views on Western education. Though the educational philosophy of ‘Allamah Iqbal is a vast subject and much has been written about it, its essence is that education should produce Khuda and the desire as well as the ability to struggle in the cause of God and Truth. Though the subject cannot be explained in all its dimensions in this translation some comprehension is essential to do justice to the poem. Western education may be beneficial to the Western people and may have been necessary for the material advancement of Indian Muslims in their special circumstances created by the British rule in the sub-continent it is detrimental to the ideals and goals of Islam as set out in the Holy Qur’an. Establishment of the “Kingdom of God on earth” in the form of the super-national Islamic State, with all its details and accompaniments, is the purpose of the mission of the Holy Prophet (S.A.W.), which was entrusted by him to his Ummah at the time of the last pilgrimage. The Holy Qur’an is replete with commands to this effect, reference to which has been made in previous poems, for example the introduction to Poem 84. Taranah-i-Milla (The National Anthem of Muslims). When viewed against this background Western education not only falls short of the needs of Muslims but is contrary to them. Being secular and materialistic it is in fact detrimental to Muslims’ aspirations and objectives. A small sample of quotations from some other poems of ‘Allamah Iqbal is given below to give some indication of his views on the subject: | (209) The school and tavern teach only not to be | Learn to be that you may be and want to be | (210) O God ! My complaints are against the schools’ lords | They are teaching mud-slinging to falcon’s fledglings | (211) I would not get that knowledge and wisdom for a piece of straw | Which acquaints not the ghaza with the battle-field | It appears necessary to explain here that ‘Allamah Iqbal was not opposed to all Western education. When Sir Saiyyid Ahmad Khan and his colleagues started their campaign to persuade Indian sub-continent’s Muslims to acquire Western education they had scientific and technical education foremost in mind. ‘Allamah Iqbal had the same opinion and has repeatedly emphasized the importance of science and technology for material betterment. Cf. | (212) West’s strength is in science and technology | With help of this same fire its lamp is lighted | The deleterious effects of Western education have resulted mainly from the philosophy of science and from humanities. The former has created a disbelief in the existence of a non-tangible spiritual universe, and has created belief in the mechanistic and a-rational concept of creation and operation of the material universe. This is opposed to the Qur’anic concept according to which the material universe has been created by God instead of coming into existence by accident. It has been created with a purpose and not whimsically or in sport. It also states that the material universe in not eternal and will also end in its present form. The Holy Qur’an is replete with this message which emphasizes its importance, e.g. 3:191; 15:85; 16:3; 21:16-17; 39:5; 44:39; 45:22; and 46:73. The Holy Qur’an also teaches us that God has not rested or retired after creating the universe but is actively directing its affairs. Denial of this concept deprives Man of faith in the life Hereafter and the accountability for one’s deeds on earth. This deprivation leads to the cardinal vice of materialism according to which this world and life in it is the be-all and end-all of existence. This inculcates jealousy and greed for acquiring material wealth and arrogance when it has been acquired. This triple-headed monster of jealousy, greed and arrogance brings out a plethora of vices out of the Pandora’s box. One has to look around himself in the present day world to appreciate the truth of this. The whole of the modern world has been plunged into the vortex of a moral and spiritual storm which has destroyed all humane values. The cure lies in reverting to the spiritual values taught by the Holy Qur’an. | The following small sample is presented to reflect ‘Allamah Iqbal’s thought about the deprivation of the Western education from the higher concepts of existence: | (213) They conceal the higher motives from the human eye | Put the soul to sleep and awaken the material eye! | (214) The West dark with the smoke of machines is | This Valley of Aiman unwortly of Effulgence is'",

Musa A.S. was guided through wahy to search for S. Khizar A.S. for obtaining eternal secrets.

Many poems in the book express ‘Allamah Iqbal’s frustration at the state of affairs in the Muslim world and the Muslim society in it. Khizar-i-Rah is the last such poem . Perusal of these poems creates some degree of frustration in the reader which is only temporary till he reads the next poem. tulu-i-Islam leaves the reader filled with lasting enthusiasm produced by the message of hope contained in it, as he finishes the serious part of the book. | The poem was written in the early 1920s soon after World War I, and deals with the aftermath of that war with respect to the Muslims. Though it deals with the defeat and dismemberment of the `Uthmaniyah Khilafah into small secular nation states and complete subjugation of these states by the Western Christian powers at the end of the war, it brings the good news of hope and encouragement. It consists of nine stanzas, each with a different cadence and covers the following subjects: | 1. The starting point and the leading theme is the reassuring thought that the time has come for re-awakening of the Muslim world and re-assertion of Islamic values. | 2. In order to regain their past glories Muslims must: | (a) Recognize the elevated place of Man in the universe, which can be attained only by acquiring Islamic virtues, and appreciate the unity of mankind, which is above race and color. This is also the essence of the teachings of the Holy Qur’an as has been explained and documented at appropriate places earlier. | (b) Recognize their high destiny as the architect of the new world order. | (c) Review the degeneration of the Muslim world, which has resulted from complaisance and ignoring the message of God in the Holy Qur’an. | (d) Recognize the value of Iman and develop it in their lives. | (e) Work together in the struggle for establishment of a new world order of a united super-national millat instead of unconnected geographical nations. | 3. Attention has been drawn to the ethical degeneration of the Western world and society to show the impropriety and inadequacy of their norms as guidelines for the Muslim world.'",

Have you heard something? | What the temple’s people’s say to the Ka`bah’s people!\n“We ask the Muslim with the disposition of a lover | If you love the idols why is enmity with the Brahman?”\nWe have lost all material resources | The thought of Judgment Day has gone also\nThe Shaikh was fighting for Endowment Acts | Ask him if there is any property left for endowment also?\nAs I tried to commit suicide the Miss exclaimed | “O lover! If you are civilized do not transgress the limits\nWithout courage or dagger suicide’s intention is strange | Even granting your pain of failure has exceeded the limits”\nI said, “O dear, give me some cash | I shall hire some Afghan from the Frontier Province”\nSo naive were they not to appreciate the Arabs’ worth | What they got was that assault and battery they escaped not\nIn the West camel is called ship of the desert | The Turks made use of this fleet not\nIn India councils are a part of the government | This is the start of our political perfection\nWe were always beggars ,begging was our way | The rich should now acquire the skill of “begging”\nMembership of the Imperial council is not at all difficult | Votes will be available; Will we be paid money also?\nMay God bless Mirza Ghalib, who has rightly said | “We are prepared to live in Delhi, how shall we subsist”?\nWhat will be a better proof of affection and fidelity | With no love for you how intolerable will this cruelty

relations with polytheists | But our nation’s people are lacking in intelligence and sense\nUnclean is the article touched by the infidel | Should listen if Muslim’s ears are amenable to truth!\nA drunkard was also present in the sermon’s assembly | To whom such talks as those of the preacher were irksome\nHe said, “It is atrocious that in such restrictions | Are imprisoned the dealings in articles of eating and drink”\nI said, “There is no difficulty for you | As in India Muslims also are liquor sellers!”\nLet us see how long this business of the East lasts | People are buying cups and jars instead of din’s goblets\nThe cure of Love is the new education’s lancet | My surgeon is drawing blood from the Millat’s vein\nThe cow one day started saying to the camel | Nothing in the world rests in one condition\nI am ignominious by breaking my rope | I hear you have also broken your nose string\nThough you are important in India for political reasons | But due to railway the Arabian desert finds no use for you\nTill yesterday you were avoiding the cow’s companionship | The voice of ‘never’ on your hanging lips was persistent\nWhat is the matter that you are so favorable to me today | That old displeasure does not exist in your heart today\nHearing this speech the camel bashfully said | I am also to be counted among your lovers\nThe envy of hundreds of camel’s ogle is your one frisk | Since long I am the lover of such a frisk\nThe effects of your tumults have spread in the forest such | That speech has produced its taste even among the speechless\nI am living only in one desert since a long time | As I have nothing I am fed on borrowed money\nIf goat, camel, cow, leopard and the lame donkey | All exist in the same condition we shall have prestige\nIf the gardener learns the lesson of uniformity | Why should not the gardens’ birds live in harmony\nGive me also the same cup as only this appears proper | You should be intoxicated, your companions should also be intoxicated\n“The patched garment of Hafiï is worthless, color him with wine | Then bring him to the market, lost and intoxicated\nLast night the mosquito related to me | The whole story of his failures\n“They give me only one drop of blood | In return for the whole night’s labor\nAnd this land owner without any effort | Sucked all the blood of the cultivator”\nThis new `verse’ was revealed to me from the jail | That the Qur’an is in the Gata and the Gata is in the Qur’an\nHow well friendship developed between Shaikh and Brahman | In this battle after all neither this nor that was winning\n“Badra” was already disgusted with the temple | “Masata” does not step out of the mosque, he is stubborn\nLife may be lost but truth should not be lost | This one principle is the core of all religions\nThey are the birds of the same feather, | Banking, landlordship, monarchy\nCapital and labor are in confrontation with each other | Let us see how many people’s expectations are destroyed\nWith cleverness and prudence this mischief cannot be delayed | Because “Wa qad kuntum biha tasta‘jilun”\nGog and Magog all have been released | The Muslim eye will see the meaning of Yansilun\nThat eternal rind has departed from the border of Sham | Shelving away all the rules and etiquette of the tavern\nIf so, how much is this the occasion for admonition | The blue sky changes its colors in a moment\nCursor certainly would be concerned with remedial measures | In the belly of obedience has started unequaled convulsion\nSir Agha Khan is demanding the delegation from India | Is this the digestive for devouring Iraq and Palestine\nOne day a dispute arose between the farmer and the owner | Each of them was saying that the land belonged to him\nThe farmer said that the field belonged to the cultivator | The owner said that the farmer had become demented\nI asked the land as to whose property it was | It replied that it was believing only this:\nWhether it be the owner or the wretched farmer | Whatever is under the sky is property of the land\nThrow them out in the alley | The new civilization’s eggs are rotten\nElection, membership, council, presidency | The nooses of independence are very strange\nThe carpenter has also been pared | The Europe’s planes are very sharp\nThe owner of the factory is a useless man | He is very pleasure loving, hard work does not suit him\nGod’s command is “Laisa lil Insani Illa Ma Sa‘a” | Fruit of laborer’s work should not be usurped by the capitalist\nI have heard this was the talk in the factory yesterday | “The artisans only in old huts have their abode\nBut what a good council hall the government has made | In this city the capitalists did not have any abode”\nThough the mosque was built overnight by the believers | Our heart being old sinner for years devout could not be\nWhat a beautiful message did Sanusa give to King Faisal | By descent you Hijaza are, but in heart Hijaza could no be\nThough eyes become wet there is no pleasure is in this weeping | If by mixture of affliction’s blood tears pink could not be\nIqbal is a good advisor, fascinates the heart in moments | He did become hero in talk, but one in deeds he could not be",

Outwardly it seems as if the poet is talking about himself, but actually he is singing Hymns in praise of God. This Ghazal excels the succeeding Ghazals in sublimity of thought, uniqueness of execution, style, figures of speech and its rapturous nature. | The poet owns his own non-existence and is conscious that he exists only because of God’s Creative Attribute. He is grateful to God for having blessed him with the boundless Passion of Love for Him, which lends wings to his poesy and he can find access to the precincts of the Absolute Being. He is a true lover of God and is not contented, like others, to realise His Essence through His Attributes. Though he is fully aware that Houris and Angels, being creatures of light, are aery, yet he can catch them in the lassoo of his imagination. His sharp and piercing glances can ruffle the moulds in which He manifests Himself, but sometimes the doubts - and conflicts that smoulder in his breast make him miss the mark. God by creating man, who is the image of God on earth, has divulged the mystery that lay hid in the womb of Nature. | Note 2: Mr. Naeem Siddiqui did not translate this ode.

His own resolves bestow\nThe empire of To‐day on him who fishes | To‐morrow’s pearl up from Time’s undertow.\nThe Frankish glassblowers’ arts can make stone run: | My alchemy makes glass flint‐hard. Pharaoh\nPlotted and plots against me; but what harm? | Heaven lifts my hand, like Moses’, white as snow;\nEarth’s rubbish‐heaps can never quell this spark | God struck to light whole deserts, His flambeau!\nLove, self‐beholding, self‐sustaining, stands | Un‐awed at the gates of Caesar or Khosro;\nIf moon or Pleiades fall my prey, what wonder— | Myself bound fast to the Prophet’s saddle‐bow!\nHe—Guide, Last Envoy, Lord of All—lent brightness | Of Sinai to our dust; Love’s eyes, not slow\nTo kindle, hail him Alpha and Omega, | Chapter, and Word, and Book. I would not go\nPearl‐diving there, for reverence of Sina‘i; | But in these tides a million pearls still grow.",

O how sad! | The Muslim is a heap of ashes, nothing more.\nO Saki, serve me that old wine again, | Let that old cup go round once more.\nLend me the wings of Love and make me fly. | Turn my dust to fireflies that flit about.\nFree young men’s minds from slavery, | And make them mentors of the old.\nThe millat’s tree is green thanks to your sap: | You are its body’s breath.\nGive it the strength to vibrate and to throb; | Lend it the heart of Murtaza, the fervour of Siddiq.\nDrive that old arrow through its heart | Which will revive desire in it.\nBlest be the stars of Your heavens; blest be | Those who spend their nights praying to You.\nEndow the young with fervent souls; | Grant them my vision and my love.\nI am a boat in a whirlpool, stuck in one place. | Rescue me and grant me mobility.\nTell me about the mysteries of life and death, | For Your eye spans the universe.\nThe sleeplessness if my tear‐shedding eyes; | The restless yearnings hidden in my heart;\nThe prayerfulness of my cries at midnight; | My melting into tears in solitude and company;\nMy aspirations, longings and desires; | My hopes and quests;\nMy mind that mirrors the times | A field for thought’s gazelles to roam\nMy heart, which is a battlefield of life, | Where legions of doubt war with faith—\nO Saki, these are all my wealth; | Possessing them, I am rich in my poverty.\nDistribute all these riches in my caravan, | And let them come to some good use.\nIn constant motion is the sea of life. | All things display life’s volatility.\nIt is life that puts bodies forth, | Just as a whiff of smoke becomes a flame.\nUnpleasant to it is the company | Of matter, but it likes to see its striving to improve itself.\nIt is fixed, yet in motion, | straining at the leash to get free of the elements.\nA unity imprisoned in diversity, | It is unique in every form and shape.\nThis world, this sex‐dimensioned idol‐house, | This Somnat is all of its fashioning.\nIt is not its way to repeat itself: | You are not I, I am not you.\nWith you and me and others it has formed | Assemblies, but is solitary in their midst.\nIt shines in lightning, in the stars, | In silver, gold and mercury.\nIts is the wilderness, its are the trees, | Its are the roses, its are the thorns.\nIt pulverises mountains with its might, | And captures Gabriel and houris in its noose.\nThere is a silver‐grey, brave falcon here, | Its talons covered with the blood of partridges,\nAnd over there, far from its nest, | A pigeon helplessly aflutter in a snare.\nStability is an illusion of eyes, | For every atom in the world pulsates with change.\nThe caravan of life does not halt anywhere, | For every moment life renews itself.\nDo you think life is great mystery? | No, it is only a desire to soar aloft.\nIt has seen many ups and downs, | But likes to travel rather than to reach the goal;\nFor travelling is life’s outfit: it | Is real, while rest is appearance, nothing more.\nLife loves to tie up knots and then unravel them. | Its pleasure lies in throbbing and in fluttering\nWhen it found itself face to face with death, | It learned that it was hard to ward it off.\nSo it descended to this world, where retribution is the law, | And lay in wait for death.\nBecause of its love of duality, It sorted all things out in pairs, | And then arose, host after host, From mountains and from wilderness.\nIt was a branch from which flowers kept | Shedding and bursting forth afresh.\nThe ignorant think that life’s impress is | Ephemeral, but it fades only to emerge anew.\nExtremely fleet‐footed, It reaches its goal instantly. | From time’s beginning to its end is but one moment’s way for it.\nTime, chain of days and nights, is nothing but | A name for breathing in and breathing out.\nWhat is this whiff of air called breath? A sword, | and selfhood is that sword’s sharp edge.\nWhat is the self? Life’s inner mystery, | The universe’s waking up.\nThe self, drunk with display, is also fond | Of solitude;—an ocean in a drop.\nIt shines in light and darkness both; | Displayed in individuals, yet free from them.\nBehind it is eternity without Beginning, | and before it is Eternity without an end; It is unlimited both ways.\nSwept on by the waves of time’s stream, | And at the mercy of their buffeting,\nIt yet changes the course of its quest constantly, | Renewing its way of looking at things.\nFor it huge rocks are light as air: | It smashes mountains into shifting sand.\nBoth its beginning and its end are journeying, | For constant motion is its being’s law.\nIt is a ray of light in the moon and a spark in stone. | It dwells In colours, but is colourless itself.\nIt has nothing to do with more or less, | With light and low, with fore and aft.\nSince time’s beginning it was struggling to emerge, | And finally emerged in the dust that is man.\nIt is in your heart that the Self has its abode, | As the sky is reflected in the pupil of the eye.\nTo one who treasures his self, | bread won at the cost of self‐respect is gall.\nHe values only bread, | he gains with head held high.\nAbjure the pomp and might of a Mahmud; | Preserve your self, do not be an Ayaz.\nWorth offering is only that prostration which | Makes all others forbidden acts.\nThis world, this riot of colours and of sounds, | Which is under the sway of death,\nThis idol‐house of eye and ear, | In which to live is but to eat and drink,\nIs nothing but the Self’s initial stage. | O traveller, it is not your final goal.\nThe fire that is you has not come, Out of this heap of dust. | You have not come out of this world; It has come out of you.\nSmash up this mountainous blockade, | Go further on and break out of this magic ring of time and space.\nGod’s lion is the self; | Its quarry are both earth and sky.\nThere are a hundred worlds still to appear, | For Being’s mind has not drained of its creative capabilities.\nAll latent worlds are waiting for releasing blows | From your dynamic action and exuberant thought.\nIt is the purpose of the revolution of the spheres | That your selfhood should be revealed to you.\nYou are the conqueror of this world Of good and evil. | How can I tell you The whole of your long history?\nWords are but a strait‐jacket for reality: | Reality is a mirror, and speech, The coating that makes it opaque.\nBreath’s candle is alight within my breast, | But my power of utterance cries halt.\nShould I fly even a hairbreadth too high, | The blaze of glory would burn up my wings.",

He also suggests to the Muslims that the only thing that can save them is for them to be true muslims, since Islam is the sharpest weapon a Muslim has.

| For, rendered blunt, lies unused the unsheathed sword of the Faithful.\nWhose despair does this latest Ordinance prove: | “To the Muslim in this age is forbidden fighting in Lord’s name”?\nSECOND COUNCILOR\nIs the clamour for “Government by the people” evil or good? | Art thou unaware of the fresh mischiefs of the world?\nFIRST COUNCILOR\nAware am I! but tells me my cosmic foresight: | No danger from what is but a masquerade for imperialism.\nWe ourselves have dressed imperialism in the garb of democracy | When man has grown to be a little self‐conscious and self‐observant.\nThe true nature of the system of imperialism lies elsewhere: | It depends not on the existence of an individual leader of a king.\nBe it a national assembly of the court of Parviz, | Whoever casts a covetous eye on other’s harvest is a king.\nHast thou not observed the democratic system of the West? | With a brilliant exterior, its interior is darker than Genghis’s.\nTHIRD COUNCILOR\nNo cause for anxiety then, if the spirit of imperialism be preserved: | But what counter‐measure to the mischief wrought by that Jew have you?\nThat Moses without Light, that Jesus without the Cross: | No prophet is he, yet with him a book he carries.\nI can hardly explain what significance does the infidel penetrating vision possess: | It is, methinks, the day of reckoning for the peoples of the East and the West.\nNo greater corruption of human nature than this would be: | Slaves have broken asunder the ropes of the masters’ tents.\nFOURTH COUNCILOR\nWatch its counteraction in the palaces of Imperial Rome: | Again did we inspire in the descendants of Caesar the dream of Caesar.\nWho is coiled round the waves of the Mediterranean? | That now expands like a pine, and then wails like a rebeck!\nTHIRD COUNCILOR\nLittle do I recognize him to be a man of far‐sighted wisdom: | (A fool!) who has thus European politics exposed.\nFIFTH COUNCILOR (TURNING TO IBLIS)\nO thou! the fire of whose breath lends stability to the world‐process: | Whenever thou wished, everything hidden presently did thou reveal.\nIt is thy fire that has transformed dead earth and water into a world of beauty and endeavour: | Inspired by thy instruction, the fool of Paradise turns a seer.\nMore closely familiar with man’s nature than thee is not He: | Who among the simpletons is known as God the Sustainer.\nThose whose business was confined to sanctifying, singing hymns and going round: | Thy sense of self‐respect has out them to shame for ever, with their heads hanging low.\nThough the wizards of Europe all are disciples to thee: | No longer have I faith in their sagacity left.\nThat Jew, that mischief‐maker, that reincarnation of Mazdak: | Each tunic is about to be torn to shreds by his fanaticism.\nBehold! the wild crow is vying with the falcon and the hyena: | Lo, how swiftly does the disposition of Time allow of a change!\nIt spread about, and covered the whole expanse of skies: | What we unwisely had taken for a handful of dust.\nSuch is the state of the ghastly dread of the morrow’s disturbance: | To‐day tremble with overwhelming awe, mountains, meadows and rivers all.\nThat world is going to turn topsy‐turvy, my Lord! | The world which resteth solely on thy governance.\nIBLIS (TO HIS COUNCILORS)\nAbsolute command have I of the world of scent and hue! | The earth, the sun, the moon and the firmaments all!\nWith their own eyes shall the West and the East witness the Spectacle: | When I but warm the blood of the nations of Europe.\nThe leaders of politics and the patriarchs of church all: | One call from me would be enough to turn them mad.\nThe fool who considers it to be mere glass‐work: | Let him dare smash the goblets and ewers of this Civilization.\nThe collars torn asunder by the hand of Nature: | Can’t be darned with the needle of the Mazdakite logic.\nHow could I be frightened by these Socialists, straying about the streets? | Wretched and straitened, distracted in mind, incoherent in speech!\nThe only menace I anticipate may come that community: | Which still a spark of ambition hidden in its ashes retains.\nAmongst this people there are still to be seen a few | Who go so far as to perform their ablutions with the tears of pre‐morning hours.\nKnows he to whom are revealed the inner secrets of Time: | Not Mazdakism, but Islam is to be the trouble of the morrow.\n2\nI do know this community is no longer the bearer of the Quran: | The same Capitalism is the religion of the Believer now.\nAnd I know, too, that in the dark night of the East | The sleeve of the holy ones of the Sanctuary is bereft of the white, illuminating hand.\nThe demands of the present age, however, spell the apprehension: | Lest the Shari‘ah of the Prophet should come to light one day:\nBeware, a hundred times beware, of the Law of the Prophet!— | The protector of women’s honour, the tester of men’s capacities, the rearer of worthy men!\nThe message of death to any kind of slavery! | No sovereigns and no monarchs, no mendicants begging!\nIt does purify wealth of all pollution: | It makes the wealthy trustees of wealth and property.\nWhat greater revolution in thought and action will there be: | Not to the crowned heads, but to God alone does this Earth belong!\nBetter, if this Law be kept hidden from the world’s eye: | So much the better, the Believer himself is deprived of inner conviction.\nBetter that he remains busy and entangled in the metaphysical theology: | Better, that he remains busy and entangled in the interpretations of the Book of God.\n3\nWhose cries of God is Most High could break the charm of the universe: | May the dark night of that God‐thinking man not ever turn bright!\nIs the Son of Mary dead or is he endowed with eternal life? | Are the Attributes of God separate from God, or do they form what He is?\nDoes the expected mean Jesus of Nazareth? | Or a Renewer, endowed with the attributes of the Son of Mary?\nAre the letters of the Word of God New or of Old? | In which of the doctrines does the salvation of the Blessed Community lies?\nAre not enough to the Faithful in this age: | These idols of worship carved by Metaphysical Theology?\n# translation missing | # translation missing\nOur safety lies in that Believer remains a slave till Doomsday: | Renouncing this transitory world for others’ sake.\nWhat is good in his case is that poetry and mysticism | Which may keep hidden from his eyes the game of Life.\nEvery moment do I dread the awakening of this community | Whose religion is, in reality, nothing short of taking account of the universe.\nKeep him well absorbed in the thought and contemplation of God in pre‐morning hours: | Ye all make him grow stronger in his monastic disposition!",

| A block of dry wood wept at porting from him.\nThe Muslim's being is where he manifests his glory: | Many a Sinai springs from the dust on his path.\nMy image was created by his- mirror, | My dawn rises from the sun of his breast.\nMy repose is a perpetual fever, | My evening hotter than the morning of Judgment Day:\nHe is the April cloud and I his garden, | My vine is bedewed with his rain.\nIi sowed mine eye in the field of Love | And reaped, a harvest of vision.\n\"The soil of Medina is sweeter than both worlds: | Oh, happy the town where dwell the Beloved!\"\nI am lost in admiration of the style of Mulla Jami: | His verse and prose are a remedy for my immaturity.\nHe has written poetry overflowing with beautiful ideas; | And has threaded pearls in praise of the Master-\n\"Muhammad is the preface to the book of the universe; | All the worlds are slaves and he is the Master.\"\nFrom the wine of Love spring many spiritual qualities: | Amongst the attributes of Love is blind devotion.\nThe saint of Bistam, who in devotion was unique, | Abstained from eating a water-melon.\nBe a lover constant in devotion to thy beloved, | That thou mayst cast thy nose and capture God.\nSojourn for a while on the Hira of the heart. | Abandon self and flee to God.\nStrengthened by God, return to they self | And break the heads of the Lat and Uzza of sensuality.\nBy the might of Love evoke an army | Reveal thyself on the Faran of Love,\nThat the Lord of the Ka'ba may show thee favour | And make thee the object of the text, \"Lo, I will appoint a vicegerent on the earth.\"",

How strange! | Our separation is separation-in-union.\nSeparation gives to this dust (i.e. man) an insight, | It gives the weight of a mountain to a straw.\nSeparation is a token of love; | It agrees with the nature of lovers.\nIf we are alive, it is due to this affliction (of separation), | And if we are immortal, it is due to it.\nWhat is \"I\" and \"He\"? It is a divine mystery | \"I\" and \"He\" are a witness to our immortality.\nThe light of the Essence is everywhere, hidden and apparent ; | To live in company is real life.\nLove does not acquire insight without company, | And without company, it does not become self-conscious.\nIn our assembly, there are divine manifestations, behold! | The world is non-existent and He is existent, behold.\nDoors and walls, cities, towns and streets are not there, | For here there is nothing existent except we and He.\nSometimes He makes Himself a stranger to us, | Sometimes He plays upon us as upon a musical instrument.\nSometimes we fashion His idol out of stone, | Sometimes we prostrate before Him without having seen Him.\nSometimes we tear every veil of Nature, | And boldly see His beautiful face.\nWhat fancy has this handful of dust? | It is due to this fancy that his inner self is illumined.\nWhat a nice fancy that he bewails in separation | And yet he grows and develops through it.\nThis separation developed in him such a spiritual insight, | That he turned his dusk into a dawn.\nHe made the ego subject to affliction: | Thus turned the ancient grief into an ever-living joy.\nHe got strings of pearls from the tears of his eyes | From the tree of bewailing he got sweet fruit.\nTo press the ego tightly to the bosom | Is to turn death into everlasting life.\nWhat is Love? It is to tie all the different stages in a knot. | What is Love? It is to pass beyond all goals.\nLove does not know of any termination, | Its dawn has no dusk.\nThere are no bends in its way as in that of intellect, | In its lustre of a moment, there is a world.\nThousands of worlds lie along our path, | How can our endeavours reach their finale?\nO traveller I live for ever and die for ever, | Take hold of the world that comes before you.\nIt is not the goal of our journey to merge ourselves in His ocean. | If you catch hold of Him, it is not fana (extinction).\nIt is impossible for an ego to be absorbed in another ego, | For the ego to be itself is its perfection.",

It is imprinting of Tawhid on the heart, | Then to strike oneself against difficulties.\nIn servitude love is nothing but an idle talk, | Our actions do not correspond with our professions.\nThe caravan of his ambition has no inclination for a journey, | It lacks faith, has no knowledge of the road, and is without a guide.\nA slave underestimates both religion and wisdom; | In order to keep his body alive, he gives away his soul.\nAlthough the name of God is on his lips, | His centre of attention is the power of the ruler—\nPower that is nothing but ever-increasing falsehood, | Nothing but falsehood can come from it.\nAs long as you prostrate before it, this idol is your god, | But as soon as you stand up before it, it disappears.\nThat God gives you bread as well as life | This god gives you bread but snatches life away.\nThat God is One par excellence, this is divided into hundred parts; | That God provides everything for everybody; this god is totally helpless.\nThat God cures the ailment of separation, | The word of this god sows the seeds of disunity.\nHe makes his worshipper intimate with himself, | And then makes his eyes, ears, and consciousness infidels.\nWhen he rides on the soul of his slave, | It is (no doubt) in his body but (in reality) is absent from it.\nAlive and yet soulless! What is the mystery? | Listen, I unfold for you its manifold meaning.\nO wise man! dying and living are | Nothing but relative events.\nFor the fish, mountains and deserts do not exist; | For the birds, the depth of the-sea is simply a nonentity.\nFor a deaf person, there is no charm in a song; | For him sound is non-existent.\nA blind man enjoys the song of the harp, | But before a display of colours, he remains unaffected.\nThe soul with God is living and lasting; | For one it is dead, for the other it is alive.\nIt is God who is living and never dies; | To live with God is absolute life;\nHe who lives without God is nothing but dead. | Although nobody weeps and bewails over him.\nTo his-eyes, thing worth seeing is hidden, | His heart is unaware of the desire for change.\nThere is no mark of devotion in his deeds; | There is no breadth of vision in his talk\nHis religion is as narrow as his world, | His forenoon is darker than the night.\nLife is a heavy burden on his-shoulders; | He nourishes death in his own bosom.\nIn his company even love suffers from manifold diseases, | With his breath is extinguished many a fire.\nFor a worm that did not rise from the earth | The sun, the moon, and the revolving sky do not exist at all.\nYou cannot expect from a slave any desire for \"vision,\" | Nor is there in him any sign of an awakened soul.\nHis eyes never bore the trouble of \"seeing\"; | He ate, slept well, and died.\nIf the ruler unfastens one bond, | He imposes another on him.\nHe produces a complex and intricate canon, | And expects from the slave unswerving obedience.\nHe sometimes shows a bit of wrath and malice towards the slave; | This increases in him the fear of sudden death.\nWhen the slave. loses all faith in himself, | From his heart vanish all desires.\nSometimes he bestows on him handsome bounty, | And also invests him with some powers.\nThe chess-player throws the chessman out, of his hand, | And raises his pawn to the status of queen.\nHe becomes so much enamoured of to-day's well-being, | That in reality he becomes a denier of to-morrow.\nHis body fattens through the benevolence of the kings, | His dear soul becomes thin like a spindle.\nIt is better that a whole village of men be destroyed | Than that a single pure soul be subjected to sorrow and grief.\nThe fetters are not on feet, but (in fact) on the heart and soul; | This is indeed a very intriguing situation.",

| It is the spirit of Ghani mourning the death of desire.\nZephyr, if you should pass over Geneva | speak a word from me to the League of Nations:\nthey have sold farmer and cornfield, river and garden, | they have sold a people, and at a price how cheap.\"\nShah-i Hamadan\nI will tell you a subtle mystery, my son: | the body is all clay, the soul a precious pearl.\nThe body must be melted for the sake of the soul, | the pure must be distinguished from the clay.\nIf you cut off a part of the body from the body, | that slice of the body will be lost to you;\nbut the soul which is drunk with vision | if you give it away, it will return to you.\nThe soul's substance resembles nothing else; | it is in bonds, and yet not in bonds;\nif you watch over it, it dies in the body, | and if you scatter it, it illuminates the gathering.\nWhat, noble sir, is the soul \"drunk with vision\"? | What does it mean to \"give the soul away\"?\nTo give away the soul is to surrender it to God, | it means melting the mountain with the soul's flame.\n\"Drunk with vision\" means discovering one's self, | shining like a star in the night-season:\nnot to discover one's self is not to exist, | to discover is to bestow the self on the Self.\nWhosoever has seen himself and has seen naught else | has drawn forth the load from the self's prison;\nthe \"drunk with vision\" who beholds himself | deems the sting sweeter than the honey\nin his eyes the soul is cheap as the air, | before him the walls of his prison tremble;\nhis axe shivers the granite rock | so that he takes his share of the universe.\nWhen he gives up the soul, his soul is truly his, | otherwise his soul is his guest but for a moment or two.\nZinda- Rud\nYou have spoken of the wisdom of foul and fair; | learned sage, expound a further subtlety.\nYou were the guide of those who behold the inner meanings | you were the confidant of the secrets of kings.\nWe are poor men, and the ruler demands tribute; | what is the origin of the sanction of throne and crown?\nShah-i Hamadan\nWhat is the origin of Kingship in East and West? | Either the consent of the peoples, or war and violence.\nExalted sir, I will speak with you plainly; | it is forbidden to pay tribute save to two persons:\neither those in authority as being among you, | whose proof and demonstration is the verse of God,\nor else a hero swift-rising like a hurricane | who seizes cities, and stakes himself in the battle,\non the day of war conquering the land by force of arms, | on the day of peace by the winning ways of love.\nYou might indeed purchase Iran and India, | but kingship cannot be bought from any man;\nvirtuous friend, the Cup of Jamshid | none shall procure from the glassmaker's shop,\nor if he procures aught, all he owns is glass, | and glass has no other property but to break.\nGhani\nWho gave to India this yearning for freedom? | Who gave the quarry this passion to be the hunter?\nThose scions of Brahmins, with vibrant hearts, | whose glowing cheeks put the red tulip to shame\nkeen of eye, mature and strenuous in action | whose very glance puts Europe into commotion.\nTheir origin is from this protesting soil of ours, | the rising-place of these stars is our Kashmir.\nIf you suppose our earth is without a spark, | cast a glance for a moment within your heart;\nwhence comes all this ardour you possess, | whence comes this breath of the breeze of spring?\nIt is from the selfsame wind's influence | that our mountains derive their colour and scent.\nDo you not know what one day a wave | said to another wave in Lake Wular?\nHow long shall we strike at each other in this sea? | Rise up, let us break together against the shore.\nOur child, that is to say, yon ancient river | fills with its roar valley and mountains and meadow;\ncontinually it smites the rocks on its path | until it uproots the fabric of the mountains.\nThat youth who seized cities, deserts and plains | took his nurture from the milk of a hundred mothers;\nits majesty strikes terror into mortal hearts; | all this is from us, not from any other.\nTo live in the bounds of the shore is a sin; | our shore is but a stone in our path.\nTo accommodate oneself to the shore is eternal death, | even though you roll in the sea morning and evening;\nlife is to leap amidst mountain and desert | happy is the wave that has transgressed the shore!\nYou who have read the lines on the brow of Life, | you who have given to the East the tumult of Life,\nyou who have a sigh that consumes the heart, | stirring you to restlessness, and us still more,\nfrom you the birds in the meadow learned their threnody, | in your tears the grasses make ablution;\nout of your genius the field of roses blossomed, | out of your hope many souls are filled with hope.\nYour cry is a bell urging the caravans; | why then do you despair of the dwellers in the Vale?\nTheir hearts are not dead in their breasts, | their embers are not extinguished under the ice;\nwait till you see, without the sound of the Trumpet, | a nation rising out of the dust of the tomb.\nDo not grieve then, visionary; | breathe out that sigh consuming all, dry and moist alike;\nmany cities beneath the turquoise heaven | have been consumed by the flame of a dervish heart.\nDominion is frailer than a bubble | and can be destroyed by a single. breath.\nThe destinies of nations have been shaped by a song, | by a song nations are destroyed and rebuilt.\nThough your lancet has pierced men's hearts, | none has perceived you as you truly are;\nyour melody springs from a poet's song, | but what you utter transcends poesy.\nStir up a new tumult in Paradise, | strike up an intoxicating air in Paradise!\nZinda- Rud\nHabituate yourself to the dervish wine and quaff it continuously; | when you become riper, hurl yourself at the dominion of Jamshid.\nThey said, \"This world of ours-does it agree with you?\" | I said, \"It does not agree\". They said, \"Then break it to pieces\".\nIn the taverns I have seen there is not one worthy adversary; | grapple with Rustam-i Dastan, have done with Magian boys!\nTulip of the wilderness, you cannot burn alone; | strike this heart- enflaming brand upon the breast of man;\nYou are the ardour of his bosom, the heat of his blood | do you not believe me? Then tear apart the flesh of the world.\nIs reason your lamp? Set it on the path to shine; | or is love your cup? Quaff it with the intimate.\nI pour forth from my eyes the bloody gouts of my heart; | my ruby of Badakhshan - pick it up, and set it in your ring.",

It is to search for a beloved, | to display one's self to another being.\nAll these tumultuous riots of being | without our beauty could not come to exist.\nLife is both transient and everlasting; | all this is creativity and vehement desire.\nAre you alive? Be vehement, be creative; | like Us, embrace all horizons;\nbreak whatsoever is uncongenial, | out of your heart's heart produce a new world\nit is irksome to the free servitor | to live in a world belonging to others.\nWhoever possesses not the power to create | in Our sight is naught but an infidel, a heathen;\nsuch a one has not taken his share of Our Beauty, | has not tasted the fruit of the Tree of Life.\nMan of God, be trenchant as a sword, | be yourself your own world's destiny!\nZinda- Rud\nWhat law governs the world of colour and scent, | but that water once flowed returns not to the stream?\nLife has no desire for repetition, | its nature is not habituated to repetition;\nbeneath the sky, reversion is unlawful to life | once a people has fallen, it rises not again.\nWhen a nation dies, it rarely rises from the grave; | what recourse has it, but the tomb and resignation?.\nThe Voice of Beauty\nLife is not a mere repetition of the breath, | its origin is from the Living, Eternal God.\nThe soul near to Him who said \"Lo, I am night\" | that is to take one's share of everlasting life.\nThe individual through the Unity becomes Divine, | the nation through the Unity becomes Omnipotent;\nUnity produced Ba Yazid, Shibli, Bu Dharr, | Unity produced, for the nations, Tughril and Sanjar.\nWithout the Divine Epiphany man has no permanence; | Our Manifestation is life to individual and nation;\nboth attain their perfection through the Unity, | life being for the latter Majesty, for the former Beauty.\nThe one is of Solomon, the other of Salman, | the one perfect poverty, the other all power:\nthe one sees there is One, the other becomes one | while in the world, sit with the former, live with the latter!\nWhat is the nation, you who declare \"No god but God\"? | With thousands of eyes, to be one in vision\nThe proof and claim of God's people are always One: | \"Our tents are apart, our hearts are one.\"\nOneness of vision converts the motes to the sun; | be one of vision, that God may be seen unveiled.\nDo not look slightingly on oneness of vision; | this is a true epiphany of the Unity.\nWhen a nation becomes drunk with the Unity | power, yea, omnipotence lies in its grasp.\nA nation's spirit exists through association; | a nation's spirit has no need of a body.\nSince its being manifests out of companionship, | it dies when the bands of companionship are broken.\nAre you dead? Become living through oneness of vision; | cease to be centreless, become stable.\nCreate unity of thought and action, | that you may possess authority in the world.\nZinda-Rud\nWho am I? Who art Thou? Where is the world? | Why is there a distance between me and Thee?\nSay, why am I in the bonds of destiny? | Why dost Thou die not, whilst I die?\nThe Voice of Beauty\nYou have been in the world dimensionate, | and any contained therein, therein dies.\nIf you seek life, advance your selfhood, | drown the world's dimensions in your self.\nYou shall then behold who am and who you are | how you died in the world, and how you lived.\nZinda-Rud\nAccept the excuses of this ignorant man; | remove the veil from the face of destiny.\nI have seen the revolution of Russia and Germany, | I have seen the tumult raging in Moslemdom,\nI have seen the contrivings of West and East | prevent the destinies of West and East.\nEpiphany of the Divine Majesty\nSuddenly I beheld my world, | that earth and heaven of mine,\nI saw it drowned in a light of dawn; | I saw it crimson as a jujube-tree:\nout of the epiphanies which broke in my soul | I fell drunk with ecstasy, like Moses.\nThat light revealed every secret veiled | and snatched the power of speech from my tongue.\nOut of the deep heart of the inscrutable world | an ardent, flaming melody broke forth.\nAbandon the East, be not spellbound by the West, | for all this ancient and new is not worth one barleycorn.\nThat signet-ring which you gambled away to Ahriman | should not be pledged even to trusty Gabriel.\nLife, that ornament of society, is guardian of itself; | you who are of the caravan, travel alone, yet go with all!\nYou have come forth brighter than the all-illumining sun; | so live, that you may irradiate every mote.\nAlexander, Darius, Qubad and Khusrau have departed | like a blade of grass fallen in the path of the wind.\nSo slender is your cup that the tavern has been put to shame; | seize a tumbler, and drink wisely, and so be gone!",

O Ganges! | how long shall we go on living sordidly like this ?\nThe old lack insight, | the young are devoid of love;\nEast and West are free, but we are slaves of others; | our bricks go to the building of others’ mansions.\nTo live according to the wish of others | is not deep slumber; it is eternal death;\nthis is not a death that comes from the sky; | its seed grows out of the depths of one’s soul.\nIts prey waits neither for the undertaker nor for the grave, | nor for friends from far and near;\nno clothes are torn in grief over his death, | his hell is not on the other side of the skies.\nDo not seek him among the crowd on the Day of Judgment, | his tomorrow lies in his today.\nWhat use is there to produce before God one | who has both sown the seed and reaped the fruit in this world?\nA nation that does not relish the prodding of desire | is wiped off the face of the earth by Nature.\nIt is through magic that the crown and the throne acquire authority | what is frail as glass becomes through magic bard as stone.\nUnder the influence of this “clear enchantment,” | Muslims abjured their faith and unbelievers, their unbelief,\nThe Indians quarrel with one another | having revived their old differences,\nuntil a Frankish nation from the land of the West | assumed the role of a mediator between Islam and kufr.\nNobody knows water from mirage, | Revolution, O revolution, O revolution!\nO you who are always anxious for material sustenance, | ask of God a living heart ;\nalthough its seat is in water and clay | yet the nine heavens are under its authority.\nDo not think it belongs to the earth, | it really comes from the highest heavens.\nThe world is for it the Friend’s abode | and gets the Friend’s smell from the tulip’s tunic.\nIt is constantly at war with the world, | the stones on the path are broken to pieces by its strokes;\nit is familiar with the pulpit and the gibbet, | and keeps a strict watch over its own fire;\nit is only a streamlet but has oceans in its lap, | its ripples bring tidings of storms;\nit is not by bread that it lives, | it dies as soon as it loses its vision of the Truth;\nit is like a lamp in the dark chamber of the body: | it illumines both multitude and solitude.\nSuch a heart, ever watchful of itself and God-intoxicated, | is not achieved except through Faqr.\nO young man, catch hold of its skirt firmly, | you have been born in slavery, now live free.",
