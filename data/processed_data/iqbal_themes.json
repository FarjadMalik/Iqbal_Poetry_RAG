{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about Longing","output":"Though outwardly this poem is a piece of \"natural poetry\" it contains, as is usual with \u2018Allamah Iqbal, his basic philosophy of Khuda or the pre-eminence of Man in the God's creation. The poem says that though the beautiful rose, as an object of beauty in the creation of God, is \"a joy for ever\", it is devoid of the feelings of longing for comprehension of the Truth, which faculty is the gift of God specially endowed upon Man.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about tur","output":"This poem, though simple in language, is charged with mystic thought. As this is the first poem of its kind in this book and many more will follow it appears appropriate to clarify a few points. The commonplace phenomena of \"Gul-O-Bulbul \" (the association of the flower and the nightingale), and \"Sham`-o-Parwanah\" (the candle and the moth) have always been symbolic of the lover-beloved relationship in Persian and Urdu poetry. However, much of this poetry has long been conventional and poems have been evaluated on the basis of their linguistic beauty, innovative expressions and elegance of style without paying much attention to the subject matter or the depth of thought expressed in the poem. | Poetry is a spontaneous expression of human emotions. The most important human emotion is love, both of the material form and that of the innate qualities of the beloved. Pre-Islamic poetry was usually amorous. Wine with its accompaniments of the cup, the goblet, the decanter, the cup bearer and the tavern were commonly used. Though this practice prevailed in all literatures it was most predominant in the pre-Islamic Arabic poetry. Exaggeration was a very common and much liked attribute of poets and poetry. For that reason the Holy Qur'an frowned at poets (26:224-26). However, it should be remembered that the above verse does not amount to outright condemnation of all poets and all poetry, but is only a passing remark on the aspect of misleading others by exaggeration. Reference to the Holy Qur\u2019an 26:221-24 would clarify this statement. | The world is heavily indebted to Islam and Muslims for metamorphosing romantic poetry and sublimating it from amorous love to that of Divine Love. God, the Holy Prophet S.A.W. and his descendants became the \"beloved\" instead of human forms. Thus, mundane, albeit natural, human emotion was sublimated into pure and angelic form. Acts of worship became changed from mere rituals to submission to the Will of God and fear motivated exercises became sublimated to those of the Love of the highest order (The Holy Qur\u2019an 41:37). New forms of poetry, like \"hamd\", \"na\u2018t\" , \"thana\" marthiah and new kinds of music, like \"qawwala \", came into existence for the expression of Man's Love for God, the Holy Prophet S.A.W. and his descendants, as well as for other heroes and heroines of Islam. | All the terminology, conventionally used in amorous poetry, like wine, cup, goblet, decanter, cup bearer and tavern acquired new meanings. In fact mysticism itself changed from a vague, esoteric, occult concept into one of concrete, systematic effort for the comprehension of the Ultimate Truth about the Existence as well as the Essence of God, based on the feelings of the heart of a true Lover of Him, rather than through dry and insipid reasoning of the philosopher. A whole technique was developed for seeking the Divine Light and for expressing human Love for the Divine Being. This technique has borne the test of the criterion of repeatability required by the scientific method. The new science acquired the name of \"Tasawwuf\" or \"Sufism\". | In this poem the poet has sublimated the proverbial love of the moth for the candle into the Love of a Mu\u2019min for God. The poem will become full of meaning if read in this light.\n\nO Candle! Why does the moth love you? | Why is this restless soul devoted to you?\nYour charm keeps it restless like mercury | Did you teach it the etiquette of Love?\nIt circumambulates the site of your manifestation | Is it inspired with the fire of your lightning?\nDo the woes of death give it the peace of life? | Does your flame possess the quality of eternal life?\nIf you do not brighten this sorrowful world | This burning heart's tree of Longing may not green up\nFalling before you is the prayer of this little heart | The taste for impassioned Love knows this little heart\nIt has some zeal of the Primeval Beauty's Lover | You are a small tur it is a small Kalam\nThe moth and the taste for the Sight of the Light! | This small insect and the Longing for the Light!","poem_id":"","theme":"tur"}

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about shore","output":"This is the first poem in Bang-i-Dara representing \u2018Allamah Iqbal's nationalistic sentiments. He laments lack of amity between the Muslims and Hindus, which were the two major nations in the Indian sub-continent. His pain was aggravated by the fact that this lack of amity was delaying the independence of India from Britain. Several poems on this subject will follow. These poems have created misunderstanding about the political ideology of \u2018Allamah Iqbal. Opinion has been expressed by some responsible persons that he was initially an Indian nationalist and was only swept away by the \"separatist ideology of the Muslim League\" into what the Indian Hindus call \"communalism\". This opinion betrays complete ignorance of the works and thought of \u2018Allamah Iqbal as well as the basics of Islam. | Allamah Iqbal loved India and its natural beauty and had respect for its heroes and heroines 1. He wanted to establish Hindu-Muslim amity to hasten India's independence from Britain. However, his political ideology was not the Western style democratic system but pan-Islamism.\n\nConsumed with grief I am, I get relief in no way | O circumambient waters of the Ganges drown me\nOur land foments excessive mutual enmity | What unity ! Our closeness harbors separation\nEnmity instead of sincerity is outrageous | Enmity among the same barn\u2019s grains is outrageous\nIf the brotherly breeze has not entered in a garden | No pleasure can be derived from songs in that garden\nThough I exceedingly love the real closeness | I am upset by the mixing of waves and the shore\nThe miraculous poet is like the grain from the barn | The grain has no existence if there is no barn\nHow can beauty unveil itself if no one is anxious for sight | Lighting of the candle is meaningless if there is no assembly\nWhy does the taste for speech not change to silence | Why does this brilliance not appear out from my mirror\nAlas!

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about Love","output":"The ordinary candle is a world unto itself in Persian and Urdu literatures. It is taken as an emblem of a beloved as well as that of a lover. As a beloved the moth circles round it and eventually dies in its love. As a lover it is presented as weeping in the agony of separation from its beloved. In this poem \u2018Allamah Iqbal has equated candle with Man as both are afflicted with the agony of separation from the Creator and Beloved, i.e. God. There is, however, one difference. Man is endowed with \"feeling\", which raises him above the candle and, in fact, above all creation. This quality is a part of the attribute of Khuda 1 which has entitled Man to be endowed with knowledge, on account of which God has ranked him as the masterpiece of creation and His vicegerent on earth (The Holy Qur'an 2:30-34). Endowed with this attribute Man was transferred from Paradise to earth to witness the Jamal and Jalal of God as conveyed by the kaleidoscope of His creation and as communicated to Man through his qualities of knowledge and perception. However, this world is the temporary abode of Man and he has been charged with the mission of maintaining its beauty and protecting it from disturbances in the physical as well as spiritual spheres.

The city life, represented by worldly assemblages in the poem, stands for materialism whose benefits are obtained through Intellect. They provide material comforts but do not satisfy the heart and conscience. The life represented by the abode in the wilderness stands for life of Intuition, which harmonizes Man's existence with the orchestra of the creation of God in nature and helps him to rise in moral stature.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about neglecting","output":"The introduction to the Poem 14. Sham\u2018a Awr Parwanah outlines the influence of Islam on transforming the pre-Islamic \"love\" in literary works, especially poetry from amorous love to the God\u2019s Love, the love of the Holy Prophet S.A.W and his descendants and love of Man. This resulted in the appearance of the mystical poetry of Islam. This class of poetry deals with the Love of God and Love of mankind. This love, directly or indirectly, forms the subject of many of \u2018Allamah Iqbal's poetic works. Such Love has several facets and attributes and imposes several responsibilities and duties and confers different degrees of felicity upon the Lover. These matters are contained in several poems and they will come to light as we proceed with this commentary. | One facet of such Love is the pathos of separation from the Beloved, i.e. God and the ardent Longing in the Lover's heart to establish and witness the Unity of Man in the terrestrial world, as a part of the Islamic State's ideology and the Audience with God in the spiritual world after death. According to the Holy Qur\u2019an 56:8-56, and particularly 10-11 attainment of the latter goal in the Hereafter is the highest felicity for a true Mu\u2019min . The attainment of these two super felicities require real Love without even a shadow of ostentation. The Lover is required to keep his Love concealed in his breast and this poem emphasizes this duty and obligation of the Lover. | This poem has undertones of \"Wahdat-al-Wujud\" in which `Allamah Iqbal believed earlier in his life. This theory postulates that all creation including Man is part and parcel of the same entity, i.e. the Eternal Being. Man has been separated from that Being by being born and this separation haunts him all his life. | (162) God was when nothing had been and would have been if nothing had been | Destroyed I am by being!

You should not be striving for ostentation! | You should not be obligated to the nightingale's lament!\nThe tulip's wine-cup should be devoid of wine | The dew's tear should be a mere drop of water\nYour secret should be hidden in the bosom somewhere | Your heart -melting tear should not be your betrayer\nThe flowery-styled poet's tongue should not be talking | Separation's complaint should not be concealed in flute's music\nThis age is a critic, go and somewhere conceal yourself | In the heart in which you are residing conceal yourself\nThe learning's surprise is neglecting you, beware! | Your immature eye is not the seeker of Truth, beware\nLet the elegant thought remain in search of Truth | Let your wisdom-loving eye remain in astonishment\nThis is not the garden whose spring you may be | This is not the audience worthy of your appearance\nThis audience is the lover of the material sights | The purpose of your sight is the closet of secrecy\nEvery heart is intoxicated with the wine of thinking | Something different is the tur of the Kalams of this age","poem_id":"","theme":"neglecting"}

Now there is no pleasure in display\nBeware! You should not be striving for ostentation! | You should not be obligated to the nightingale's lament!\nThe tulip's wine-cup should be devoid of wine | The dew's tear should be a mere drop of water\nYour secret should be hidden in the bosom somewhere | Your heart -melting tear should not be your betrayer\nThe flowery-styled poet's tongue should not be talking | Separation's complaint should not be concealed in flute's music\nThis age is a critic, go and somewhere conceal yourself | In the heart in which you are residing conceal yourself\nThe learning's surprise is neglecting you, beware! | Your immature eye is not the seeker of Truth, beware\nLet the elegant thought remain in search of Truth | Let your wisdom-loving eye remain in astonishment\nThis is not the garden whose spring you may be | This is not the audience worthy of your appearance\nThis audience is the lover of the material sights | The purpose of your sight is the closet of secrecy\nEvery heart is intoxicated with the wine of thinking | Something different is the tur of the Kalams of this age","poem_id":"","theme":"Kalams"}
{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about flute","output":"This poem is not just a picture of autumn in the garden when the rose and other flowers wither away and present a picture of sadness and desolation. It is a metaphorical elegy of the sad state of affairs of the Muslim Ummah. The description of the life of the rose in the spring, in the first three verses, represents the period of the glory of the Ummah, and the period of autumn, in the last three verses, represents its present state. The last two verses indicate \u2018Allamah Iqbal's frustration which can be appreciated only by those similarly afflicted.\n\nO withered rose! How can I still call you a rose? | How can I call you the longing of nightingale's heart?\nOnce the zephyr's movement was your rocking cradle | In the garden's expanse joyous rose was your name\nThe morning breeze acknowledged your benevolence | The garden was like perfumer's tray by your presence\nMy weeping eye sheds dew on you | My desolate heart is concealed in your sorrow\nYou are a tiny picture of my destruction | You are the interpretation of my life's dream\nLike a flute to my reed-brake I narrate my story | Listen O rose!

Firstly, \u2018Allamah Iqbal wants to expose the formalism ostentation and pretentiousness of the common, so called \u2018Ulama. In their view Islam is restricted to the observance of a few formal rules of the Islamic law and that too only in the letter of the law and not in its spirit. Secondly, he wants to bring out his own universality as far as the orbit of Islamic learning is concerned. \u2018Allamah Iqbal's knowledge of and service to Islam is multi-dimensional and multi-faceted to the extent that it is difficult to say whether he was a poet, an exegesist of the Holy Qur'an, an Islamic revivalist, a philosopher, or a sufi. Study of his books will show that he was all these par excellence. This is what he means in the last four verses.\n\nI am only relating to you the story of a mawlava | I have no intention of showing my smartness\nHis pious nature was widely known | All the high and low respected him\nHe used to say that Shara\u2018ah was veiled in tasawwuf | As meanings were veiled within words\nHis heart's flask was filled to the brim with piety's wine | He also had lees of the thought of pantology at the bottom\nHe often used to describe his supernatural powers | He always intended increase of his disciples' numbers\nHe had been living in my neighborhood since long | The ascetic and the rind were mutual friends since long\nThe dignitary asked a friend of mine one day | \"Iqbal who is a dignitary in the field of literature\nHow is he in the obedience to the rules of Shara\u2018ah ? | Though in poetry he is envy of the Kalam of Hamadan\nI hear he does not consider the Hindu a non-believer | He has such beliefs as a result of philosophy\nHe has accepted a little bit of Shiaism also | I have heard the greatness of \u2018Ala from him\nHe considers music as part of adoration | He aims at making a mockery of religion\nHe does not feel shy with amorous people | This is a very old habit of our poets\nHe has music at night, Qur\u2019an's recitation in the morning | This secret is not yet fully understood by me\nBut the information obtained from my disciples is | That spotless like the dawn's whiteness his youth is\nHe is not Iqbal but a strange mixture of opposites he is | Treasure of wisdom is his heart, but enigmatic his temper is\nHe knows spiritual freedom as well as the Shara\u2018ah | Regarding tasawwuf, he is second only to Mansur\nI am unable to understand his reality | Founder of another kind of Islam he appears to be\"\nIn short he prolonged his sermon very much | He long continued this wonderful speech\nEveryone soon hears all happenings in this city | I myself heard it through my friends in the city\nOne day as the respected ascetic met me in the street | The old story restarted during the talk in the street\nHe said, \"That accusation was due to my affection | It was my duty to show you the path of the Shara\u2018ah\"\nI said, \"I have no intention of any complaint at all | It was your right due to being my neighbor\nI bow my head respectfully before you | My youth is accustomed to respect for the old\nIf you do not know the reality about me | It does not show any lack of pantology\nI myself do not know my reality | Very deep is the sea of my thoughts\nSince long I am also longing to see Iqbal | For long I have shed tears in his separation\nIqbal also is not acquainted with Iqbal | There is no joke in it, by God he is not","poem_id":"","theme":"tasawwuf"}

For greater details attention is invited to \u2018Allamah Iqbal's two books titled Asrar-i-Khuda and Rumuz-i-Bekhuda. The net result of the loss of Khuda has led the present day Man away from submission to God and towards submission to \u00f3aghut.

It is not sufficient to claim the Love of God verbally.

It is not sufficient to claim the Love of God verbally.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about rose","output":"This short poem in three parts, different in cadence, deals with important mystic concepts through the common-place fire fly. The first part extols the beauties of the insect in different ways, and presents it as a reflection of the creative power of God. The next two parts show how the creativity of God appears in all His creatures throughout the universe, examples of which have been taken only from the common creatures and phenomena familiar to the denizens of the earth, to make the subject easily intelligible to the common man. The essence of the poem is the twin concept of Tawhad-i-Ilah (The Unity of God) and Tawhad-i-Insaniyat (The Unity of Mankind). This is mentioned in the last two verses. The coherence in the diversity of the universe points to the Unity of the Creator in the plurality of the universe.\n\nThe fire-fly's light is shining in the garden's abode | Or a candle is lighted in the assembly of flowers ?\nHas some star flown down from the sky? | Or has a moon's ray been brought to life?\nOr the emissary of the day has come to the night's kingdom? | Has become prosperous in foreign land was unknown in homeland\nHas some button fallen from the cloak of the moon? | Or some speck has become prominent in the sun's shirt?\nWas it the concealed glimpse of the Eternal Beauty? | Which was brought by Nature out of solitude into the assembly\nDarkness as well as light is in this little moon | Now it is out of eclipse, now it is in eclipse\nThe moth is an insect, as the fire-fly is an insect | The former needs light, the latter is light's embodiment\nNature gave beauty to everything in the universe | It gave agitation to moth, it gave light to fire-fly\nIt gave flowery music to the speechless bird | Having given tongue to the rose taught it to be silent\nThe beauty of twilight's spectacle was decaying | Brightening up this fairy, a short life it gave\nIt gave color to the dawn like a beautiful bride | Clothing it in red dress gave it the mirror of dew\nIt gave shade to the tree, gave flight to the wind | It gave flow to water, gave restlessness to waves\nThis distinction but is a way of our thinking | The fire-fly's day is the same as our night\nThe Eternal Beauty's reflection is present in everything | It is speech in man. It is blooming in the flower bud\nThis moon in the sky is the poet's heart so to say | It is moonlight there what here the prick of pathos is\nThe manners of speech have deceived us, otherwise | Song is nightingale's fragrance, flower's fragrance is its song\nConcealed in plurality is the secret of the Unity | What is fire-fly\u2019s brightness is flower\u2019s fragrance\nWhy should this difference be occasion for dissensions? | When the Primeval Day\u2019s silence be concealed in everything","poem_id":"","theme":"rose"}

Is the uninhabited homeland of mine | The tattered skirt of the morning is my shroud\nMy destiny is dying and being born every day | Drinking morning draft of wine from the hand of death's cup-bearer\nThis service, this honor, this elegance is not good | Darkness is better than this ephemeral illumination\nIf I had the power, I would have never become a planet | I would have become the shining pearl in the ocean's depth\nThere also if I would have become weary of the waves' struggle | Leaving the ocean I would have become some neck's decoration\nThe pleasure of brightness is in being some beauty's ornament | In being the ornament of the crown of the princess of Caesar\nAs the fortune of a piece of stone gained ascendancy | It did not stop short of being jewel of Sulaiman's ring\nBut breaking is the end of such things in the world | Breaking is the end of the invaluable pearls\nReal life is the one which is not acquainted with death | What good is the life in which there is demand of death?\nIf this is the end of being the decoration of the universe | Why should I not fall as dew on some flower?\nI should live as shining specks in the decoration of someone's forehead | I should live in the sparks of some oppressed person's sighs\nAs tear I be entangled in the eye lashes of someone | Why should I not drip from the eyes of that lady?\nWhose husband, clad in the chains\u2011armor is departing | To battlefield, compelled by the love of the homeland\nWho may be exhibiting hope and despair's spectacle | Whose silence may be putting speech to embarrassment\nTo whom pleasing the husband may give the strength for patience | And to whose eyes' modesty may give the power to speak\nWhose rosy cheeks at departure's time may be turned pale | Attraction of whose beauty by separation's sorrow may be enhanced\nHowever hard she may control but still I may drip | I may spill over from the cup of the tearful eye\nAfter mixing with dust I may get eternal life | And departing, I may show warmth of Love to the world","poem_id":"","theme":"decoration"}

This should be the ambition and desire of every Mum\u2019in.\n\nWhat angels recite is your exalted name | Your threshold is exalted, your munificence is gerneral\nThe stars are stable by the attraction of your Love | Your system is like the system of the sun\nThe pilgrimage to your tomb is life for the heart | Your status is higher than those of Masih and Khidar\nThe Beloved\u2019s Nature is veiled in your Love | High is your dignity, exalted is your veneration\nIf my heart has a stain the stain is of your love | But if cheerful I am, I am the rose of your spring\nLeaving the garden I have come out like the rose of your fragrance | I am determined to go through the test of perseverance\nI have started with zeal from the homeland\u2019s tavern | The pleasure of the wine of knowledge is speeding me up\nI am gazing at the mercy\u2019s cloud, I am the wilderness tree | With the Mercy of God I am not in need of the gardener\nMay I be living elegantly in the world like the sun | May I be bestowed with that ladder by your blessings\nMay I be so far ahead of the fellow travelers | That I may be regarded as the destination by the caravan\nMay my pen not hurt anybody\u2019s feelings | May I have complaint against none under the sun\nWhose effect may penetrate the hearts like a comb | May I receive such a clamor from your threshold\nThe nest I had made by picking up bits and pieces | May I see the same nest in the garden again\nMay I come back to put my forehead at my parents\u2019 feet | Whose efforts made me the confidante of love\nThat candle of the audience of the Holy Prophet\u2019s descendants | Whose threshold I will always consider like the Haram\nWhose breath opened the flower bud of my longing | By whose benevolence I became sagacious\nPray to the terrestrial and the celestial world\u2019s Lord | That I may again become happy with paying homage to him\nThat second Yusuf to me, that candle of Love\u2019s assembly | Whose brotherly love has given soul\u2019s tranquillity to me\nWho in his love, destroying the book of \u201cyou and I\u201d | Has brought me up to my youth in the environment of happiness\nMay he remain happy in the world like rose | Whom I have always held dearer than my life\nBlooming, my heart\u2019s bud may become a flower! | May this traveler\u2019s request be accepted!","poem_id":"","theme":"Khidar"}

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about Love","output":"This poem has a personal reference to a very close friend of \u2018Allamah Iqbal, named Swama Ram Tarath (1873- 1906) and was written at the time of the latter\u2019s death when \u2018Allamah Iqbal was in England. Swama Ram Tarath had a very brilliant career and passed all public examinations from High School to M.A. in Mathematics in the first division. He worked in different capacities during the period 1895-99 at the American Mission High School at Sialkot and Foreman Christian College at Lahore. He also worked at the latter institution as Alexander Fellow for a short period. He soon resigned and devoted himself to the study, practice, and teaching of the Hindu Vedant philosophy. One component of it is oath of celibacy. The Swama could not keep this oath when he went to the United States for preaching. He soon returned to India without his family and died by drowning in 1906, while bathing in River Ganga at Hardwar, one of the Holy places of Hindus. It is said to be an act of atonement for his sin of marriage. | The poem pays tribute to him, calling him a drop which united with the ocean in a way similar to the union of Man on death with God, according to the Vedant philosophy. The poem also deals with the broader share of Tawhad and ardent Love of God.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about breast","output":"This is another short poem in which \u2018Allamah Iqbal has used a common object like the flower bud to explain mystic secrets and to show the way to recognizing, loving and revering God. The sun is one of His prominent creations and the influence of the sun produces the marvels and mysteries of the flower bud. Through the flower bud one can comprehend God. The Holy Qur\u2019an has repeatedly appealed to Man to recognize the Existence of God on the basis of the innumerable signs in the afaq (the universe) round us. The following verses specifically refer to the signs based on the sun and the phenomena connected with it: 2:164; 3:190; 6:95-99; 10:5-6; 17:12; 30:20-27; 36:37-40; and 45:3-6. The poem also supports the theory of Wahdat al- Shuhud.\n\nWhen the dawn uncovers its beautiful cheek | The flower bud uncovers its golden breast\nIt is manifest in the dawn's tavern | Its life is in the goblet of the sun\nIt opens up its heart before the sun | It enjoys the Love's anguish immensely\nMy sun ! You should also lift your veil some time | My restless eye is impatient to witness your sight\nMay the abode of your manifestations be in my heart | May your reflection flourish in the mirror of my breast\nMay your sight be the life for my heart | May your light be the cradle of my heart\nMay every speck of mine full of pleasure be again | May life's warmth appear again in the skill of my thoughts\nMay I view my sun's sight from the distance | May I embrace its light like a flower bud\nMay I highlight the reality of the restless life | May I also open the secret of heart 's thoughts","poem_id":"","theme":"breast"}

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about Sharab-i-tuhur's","output":"This is another short poem which is highly mystical and difficult to understand. Tasawwuf is based on the inability of the human Intellect to comprehend the marvels and mysteries of the celestial and spiritual worlds. Matters like the Existence of God can be argued for and against with Intellect and logic. Its logic can be understood with the study of \"Anfus o Afaq\" to which the Holy Qur'an has repeatedly referred for this purpose. Spiritual philosophers and sufis have adjudged God as \"Wajib al-Wujud\" (the Being whose Existence is essential for the creation and operation of the universe). However, His Dhat (Essence) is incomprehensible and indescribable. For that reason the Islamic system has established ninety nine names, which are really attributes, by which we can get some feeling for His Nature, but not knowledge. `Ibadah, in the broad sense and meditation can enable a person to feel His Essence. Similarly, other spiritual objects, like Paradise and Hell are beyond human comprehension, and their nature can only be felt, rather than described. The Holy Qur'an and Hadith literatures have used highly metaphorical language so as to make the subject somewhat intelligible to the persons of average intelligence. Any other kind of description would have been intelligible to the super or ultra-intellectuals only, if at all. Furthermore, it would have led to perpetual arguments and schisms among Muslims as has happened in other religions, based on philosophies. With this in the background of his thoughts \u2018Allamah Iqbal warns us in this poem, in a sarcastic style, that literal explanations of the descriptions of spiritual objects in the Holy Qur'an and Hadith literatures on these matters can lead to gross misunderstanding, particularly in the young and immature minds. \u2018Ibadah and meditation are the only means of getting some feeling of these subjects. The following excerpt discusses resurrection and its aftermath: | \u201cThe point, however, which has caused much difference of opinion among Muslim philosophers and theologians is whether the re\u2011emergence of Man involves the re\u2011emergence of his former physical medium. Most of them, including Shah Wali Allah, the last great theologian of Islam, are inclined to think that it does involve at least some kind of physical medium suitable to the ego's new environment. It seems to me that this view is mainly due to the fact that the ego, as an individual, is inconceivable without some kind of local reference or empirical background. The Holy Qur'an 50:3,4 throw some light on this point. | 'What ! When dead and turned to dust, shall we rise again ? Remote is such a return'. Now know what the earth consumeth and what with us is as a book in which account is kept .\u2019 | To my mind these verses clearly suggest that the nature of the universe is such that it is open to it to maintain in some other way the kind of individuality necessary for the final working of human action, even after the disintegration of what appears to specify his individuality in his present environment. What that other way is we do not know. Nor do we gain any further insight into the nature of the 'second creation' by associating it with some kind of body, however subtle it may be. The analogies of the Holy Qur\u2019an only suggest it as a fact; they are not meant to reveal its nature and character. Philosophically speaking, therefore , we cannot go further than this \u2011 that in view of the past history of Man it is highly improbable that his career should come to an end with the dissolution of his body. | However, according to the teaching of the Holy Qur'an the ego's re\u2011emergence brings him a \"sharp sight\" whereby he clearly sees his \"self\u2011built fate fastened round his neck\" (50:21-22) (read with 17:13). Heaven and Hell are states, not localities. The descriptions in the Holy Qur'an are visual representations of an inner fact, i.e. character. Hell, in the words of the Holy Qur\u2019an, is ' God's kindled fire which mounts above the heart ' ! -- \u00adthe painful realization of one's failure as a Man. Heaven is the joy of triumph over the forces of disintegration. There is no such thing as eternal damnation in Islam. The word 'eternity' used in certain verses, relating to Hell, is explained by the Holy Qur\u2019an itself to mean only a period of time (78:23). Time cannot be wholly irrelevant to the development of personality. Character tends to become permanent; its re\u2011shaping must require time. Hell, therefore, as conceived by the Holy Qur\u2019an is not a pit of everlasting torture inflicted by a revengeful God; it is a corrective experience which may make a hardened ego once more sensitive to the living breeze of Divine Grace. Nor is Heaven a holiday. Life is one and continuous. Man marches always onwards to receive ever fresh illuminations from an Infinite Reality, 'which every moment appears in a new glory'. And the recipient of Divine Illumination is not merely a passive recipient. Every act of free ego creates a new situation, and thus offers further opportunities of creative unfolding.\"\n\nYou should not tell me, \"Death is a message of luxury and pleasure\" | You should not draw the picture of Sharab-i-tuhur's ecstasy \u00ad\nDo not feel grieved by separation from the Houri | Do not present the Houri in the mirror of words\nDo not make me fascinated by the beautiful cup\u2011bearer | Do not describe the Houri, do not relate the Salsabal\u2019s story\nI do not doubt Paradise being the place of peace | Your message is not proper for the life's prime!\nAh!

Every act of free ego creates a new situation, and thus offers further opportunities of creative unfolding.\"\n\nYou should not tell me, \"Death is a message of luxury and pleasure\" | You should not draw the picture of Sharab-i-tuhur's ecstasy \u00ad\nDo not feel grieved by separation from the Houri | Do not present the Houri in the mirror of words\nDo not make me fascinated by the beautiful cup\u2011bearer | Do not describe the Houri, do not relate the Salsabal\u2019s story\nI do not doubt Paradise being the place of peace | Your message is not proper for the life's prime!\nAh! How long should youth linger in hope | Joy is not joy for which you remain waiting\nWhat worth is the beauty which is in need of the discerning eye | Which is obligated for the tomorrow for its manifestation\nStrange is the feeling for life | \"Today's joy\" is the belief of youth","poem_id":"","theme":"Salsabal\u2019s"}
{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about life","output":"This short poem is an eloquent but sad commentary on the status of Man as it stands at present. All creation in the universe is bound by the laws of its Creator and is busy in the performance of the tasks assigned to it. All creatures enjoy obeying their Creator. However, Man, the masterpiece of creation, by misusing his autonomy, disobeys the laws of his Creator and has landed himself in very un\u2011enviable situation of strife and other forms of suffering with the added affliction that there is none to sympathize with him in his travail.\n\nWhat an ingenious tyranny of Nature it is! | Man has been made a seeker of the Secret\nThe Secret has been concealed from his eyes | The taste for awareness is restless\nThe secret of life is not un\u2011raveled | Amazing is the alpha and omega of life\nWhat else is there in the mirror's house? | The river stream is moving fast\nThe river is moving towards the ocean | The wind is blowing the cloud\nIs bringing the cloud on its shoulders | Stars are intoxicated with destiny's wine\nThey are chained in the prison of the sky | The sun, that early rising devotee\nThat carrier of the message of \"rise\" | Concealed in the hills of the west\nIs drinking wine in twilight's goblet | Everything is enjoying its existence\nIt is intoxicated with manifestation's wine | None is sympathetic with Man!","poem_id":"","theme":"life"}

These feelings attained their climax when he reached the Island of Sicily on his return journey to India. | Sicily had been conquered by the Aghlabad Dynasty of Tunisia in the early ninth century and was ruled by them as well as by other Arab dynasties till it was conquered back by the Normans in the second half of the eleventh century.

The Muslim world, which at one time was spread over northern Africa, southern Europe, central, southern and south\u2011eastern Asia and was the cradle of the highest civilization of all times, and in moral and ethical spheres, was the highest power, had crumpled down by his time. This sight must have brought to his mind the whole panorama of the period of Muslim suzerainty in Africa and southern Europe.

In contrast with the memory of the past glory must have passed his mind the extremely poor condition of the Muslim world in his time. This reminiscence must have made \u2018Allamah Iqbal very painfully sad as is evident from the verses of this poem. | At that time little did \u2018Allamah Iqbal know that the Muslim Ummah would have to go through much more afflictions than imagined at that time, till he cried out in 1924: | Rendered cheap like water is the blood of the Muslim | You are agitated as your heart is not aware of the secret | More perturbing than the affliction itself was his life\u2011long realization which poured out of his afflicted heart in 1935: | What an outrage, extinguished is the Love's fire | The Muslim is no more than a heap of burnt ashes !\n\nO blood-dripping eye! Now cry to your heart's content | There you can see the mausoleum of the civilization of Hijaz\nThis was the rendezvous of those Arab Bedouins once | The ocean was the play ground of whose boats once\nWho shook up the audience halls of emperors | Thunderbolts were harbored in whose swords\nWhose appearance was the message of birth of a new world | Whose restless sword destroyed the whole ancient world\nThe dead world with whose \"Qum\" was infused with life | Man was freed from the chains of superstitious beliefs\nThe ear is still full of pleasures from whose zeal | Is that Takbar now silenced for ever?\nAh! O Sicily! You are giving dignity to the ocean | You are like a guide post in the water's expanse\nMay the ocean's cheek ever remain elegant with your mole | May your lights ever remain a comfort for the ocean sailor\nMay your sight ever remain beautiful to traveler\u2019s eyes | May the wave on your shore's rocks ever remain dancing\nYou were the cradle of that nation's civilization once | Whose universal beauty was the object for spectacle\nThe Nightingale of Sharaz was the lamentor on Baghdad | Dagh shed the tears of blood on Jahanabad\nWhen the sky destroyed the State of Gharna\u00e8ah | The unhappy heart of Ibn Badrun lamented\nThe ill\u2011fated Iqbal has been conferred mourning for you | Destiny has selected the heart that was your confidante\nWhose story is concealed in your relics? | In your shore's silence is a style of speech\nTell me your pathos, I am also embodiment of pathos | I am the dust of the caravan of which you were a stage\nShow me the old picture painted again | Make me restless by relating the tale of bygone days\nI will take your gift towards India | I myself weep here, and will make others weep there","poem_id":"","theme":"\"Qum\""}

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about credibility?","output":"This ghazal was written in 1907, i.e. about the end of `Allamah Iqbal's stay in Europe. It is the first expression of his thoughts based on his experiences in Europe. The ghazal covers several of his favorite themes. There was a time when, as a result of the knowledge spreading from Islamic Spain, Europe was starting to be freed from the theocracy of the Roman Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire, which had kept Europe enslaved in bondage of ignorance for centuries. Europe was beginning to benefit from the Reformation and Industrial Revolution. New discoveries in material sciences as well as metaphysics were beginning to show promise that Europe would benefit ethically from the blessings of knowledge. \u2018Allamah Iqbal also was somewhat impressed by this situation as is reflected by verses 1\u20113 and 10. He also got some hope of the renaissance of the Muslim world as a result of the new general awakening, as is expressed in verses 4 and 5. However, he was not completely dazed by the apparent material progress of Europe, and tempered his earlier expressed optimism with the material of verses 7\u20119 and 12. The rest of the ghazal briefly talks about some of the Islamic values which have been repeatedly preached by him. These are: | (i) The supremacy of the Heart over Intellect (verse 11). Also see Note 8 to Poem 73 \"\u2018Abd al\u2011Qadir Key Nam (Addressed to Abd al\u2011Qadir) and Introduction to ghazal 75\u20115. | (ii) Love of humanity is of prime importance for piety and religion (verse 13). | (iii) Avoiding ostentation, and practicing perseverance and selflessness is very important in Love for God (verses 14\u201116). | (iv) Expression of his own ambition for participation in the important task of struggle for Islam's revival and renaissance (verse 15). The ghazal ends with an expression of his own condition. (verse 17).\n\nTime has come for openness, Beloved's Sight will be common | The secret which silence had concealed, will be unveiled now\nO Cup\u2011bearer! Time has gone when wine was taken secretly | The whole world will be tavern, everyone will be drinking\nThose who once wandered insane, will return to habitations | Lovers' wandering will be the same but deserts will be new\nThe Hijaz\u2019 silence has proclaimed to the waiting ear at last | The covenants established with desert's inhabitants will be re\u2011affirmed\nWhich coming out of deserts had overturned the Roman Empire | I have heard from the Qudsis that the same lion will be re-awakened\nAs the cup\u2011bearer mentioned me in the wine\u2011drinkers' assembly | The tavern's sage said, \"He is insolent, he will be disgraced\"\nO Western world's inhabitants, God's world is not a shop! | What you are considering genuine, will be regarded counterfeit\nYour civilization will commit suicide with its own dagger | The nest built on the frail branch will not be durable\nThe caravan of the feeble ants will make fleet of rose petals | However strong the ocean waves' tumult be it will cross the ocean\nThe poppy, roaming in the garden, shows its spots to every f lower-bud | Knowing that by this exhibition it will be counted among the Lovers\nO Sight! That was the One you showed us as a thousand | If this is your state what will be your credibility?\nAs I told the turtledove one day the free of here are treading on dust ! | The buds started saying that I must be the knower of the garden's secrets!\nThere are thousands of God's Lovers, who are roaming in the wilderness | I shall adore the one who will be the lover of God's people\nThis is the world's custom, O Heart! Even winking is a sin | What will our respect be if you will be restless here?\nIn the darkness of the night I shall take out my tired caravan | My sigh will be shedding sparks my breath will be throwing f lames\nIf there is nothing but show in the aim of your life | Your destruction from the world will be in a breath like spark\nDo not ask about the condition of Iqbal, he is in the same state | Sitting somewhere by the wayside he must be waiting for oppression!","poem_id":"","theme":"credibility?"}

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about fear","output":"This short and apparently simple nature poem contains the very important subject of the origin, nature and end of matter. It has been controversial since the time of Aristotelian logic whether matter is hadith or qadam. Sophisticated arguments exist on both sides. However, far from solving the problem they have left the readers confused and arguing with each other. This is one of the enigmas for comprehending which Divine guidance is needed. The Holy Qur\u2019an states that (i) matter is no eternal but has been created by God, is constantly changing in form and is being re-created, and (ii) though matter has not been destroyed since its creation it will be destroyed on the Last Day. (The Holy Qur\u2019an 10:4; 14:48; 17:49; 21:104; 27:60-66; 29:19-20; and 35:16.) The climax of the thesis is reached in the last verse of the poem. \u2018Allamah Iqbal has dealt with this matter in several poems. Cf. | (196) This universe is perhaps still being completed | Because the call of \u201dKun fa Yakun \u201d is still echoing | (197) Mere optical illusion is this quietude | Restless is every speck of the universe | The constant appearance of new forms of life at all taxonomic levels of plants and animals and the constant appearance of new stars. constellations and galaxies testify to the correctness of the first verse. Similarly, the constant movement of matter along fixed orbits from the sub-atomic elementary particles to the planets, stars, constellations and galaxies supports the second verse.\n\nAre you afraid of the moon or the dawn? | Are you conscious of the end of beauty?\nAre you afraid of being robbed of light\u2019s wealth? | Are you afraid of annihilation like the spark?\nThe sky has settled you far from the earth | It has wrapped you in gold\u2019s mantle like the moon\nIt is outrageous that your feeble life is still in fear | Your whole night passes in trembling with fear\nO shining traveler! This habitation is strange | The rise of one leads to the fall of the other\nThe birth of one sun is the death of a myriad stars | Annihilation\u2019s sleep is the ecstasy of life\u2019s wine\nFlower bud\u2019s departure is the secret of flower\u2019s birth | Is annihilation life\u2019s end, or is the equivalent of life!\nQuiescence is difficult in the universe | Only change is permanent in the universe","poem_id":"","theme":"fear"}
{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about !","output":"This and the previous poem, named \u201cStar\u201d are complementary to each other. Stars are the units or building blocks of the universe. They are marvels of the creation of God. The history of astronomy shows that the marvels and mysteries of the universe have always baffled mankind. The greatest marvel of the universe is it\u2019s organization and the coherence of the celestial bodies which constitute it. This is created by the mutual attraction of stars or gravity divinely conferred upon them. \u2018Allamah Iqbal has frequently alluded to this phenomenon in his works, often as a lesson to the Muslim Ummah to acquire the virtue of mutual love among it\u2019s constituents to create and maintain the coherence and continuity of the Islamic society. | Just as the universe is a coherent and well-organized entity the Holy Qur\u2019an , which is another marvel of the creation of God, is also a masterpiece of logical order of it\u2019s constituents. Though the Holy Qur\u2019an was revealed to the Holy Prophet S.A.W. over a period of 23 years, it\u2019s compilation and organization in the present form was done by the Holy Prophet S.A.W. himself under Divine guidance. Comprehensive overview of the Holy Qur\u2019an shows that its surahs (chapters) and ayat (verses) within the surahs are not haphazardly arranged as alleged by Islam\u2019s enemies due to ignorance or prejudice.

He has recognized 14 groups of surahs and has shown how these groups are arranged in a logical sequence and how the surahs in each group are similarly arranged. These groups are ; Surahs 1-7; 8-16; 17-21; 22-25; 26-28; 29-32; 33; 34-39; 40-46; 47-49; 50-56; 57-66; 67-94; and 95-114. Perusal of Introductions to the first surah of each group clarifies the above assertion. In addition to these groups certain surahs are arranged in pairs. In such surahs the continuation of the subject matter is shown or suggested by a cue-word, e.g. surahs 33-34, 45-46, 52-53. | The poem under study alludes to the last of the three pairs referred to above. In these surahs the continuity is shown by the word \u201cstar\u201d in the last verse of surah 52 corresponding to \u201cstars\u201d in the first verse of surah 53. Consequently, this pair of surahs is called \u201cZahrawatain\u201d or \u201cThe Two Bright Ones\u201d. The central theme of surah 52 (Al-tur or The Mount) is that the Revelation of the Holy Qur\u2019an, as that of the previous scriptures, is in accord with all the signs of God, and that the here-after is irresistible and we must prepare for it. The theme of Surah 53 (Al-Najm or The Star) is that as God is the source of all things, including Revelation, the latter is not an illusion. Illusion is in the minds of those with weak or no Iman. The central theme of these two surahs is expressed in the poem\u2019s last verse, i.e. the destruction of the universe in it\u2019s present form is inevitable and that all those existing in this universe in company will separate and will be severally responsible for their deeds. It will also be noticed that the subject matter of this poem and the previous one is continuous. | In a later edition of Bang-i-Dara the first hemistich of the first verse is written with the vowel sign, kasrah or zer, in the third word, reading it as \u201cqiran\u201d, meaning \u201cconjunction of stars\u201d. If this reading is adopted the meaning and message of the poem still remains as related above, with emphasis on the last paragraph of the same.

Though the thoughts expressed in the poem could have resulted from visit to any royal cemetery it is obvious from the fourth stanza that the cemetery was a Muslim one, which could be in his native city of Lahore or in Delhi, or even in Spain. The poem starts with expression of grief which is commonly experienced by people visiting any commentary. After describing the grandeur of the kings buried there feelings of admonition are expressed on their helplessness after death, from which they cannot return to their life. The story of the rise, decline and fall of nations teaches the same lesson. The history of the Islamic Ummah is no exception. However, the fall of this nation is reflected in his thoughts as specially painful for reasons which have been explained in other poems. Nevertheless, as is usual with him, he finishes the poem with a message of hope in the last verse.\n\nThe sky is clothed in the cloud\u2019s old tattered robe | The mirror of moon\u2019s forehead is somewhat gloomy\nThe moon light is pale in this silent panorama | The dawn is sleeping in the lap of the night\nHow astonishing is silence of the trees | This silence is the soft tune of Nature\u2019s harp\nThe heart of every speck of the universe is pathos embodied | And the silence is a sad sigh on the lips of existence\nAh ! That fort, that universal mustering ground | Is carrying millennia\u2019s weight on its shoulders\nWas full of life at one time, now is desolate | This silence is the cemetery of its past elegance\nIt is the lover of the remains of its old denizens | It is standing on the mountain top like a sentinel\nThere from the cloud\u2019s window above the sky\u2019s roof | That young green star is viewing the universe\nThe earth\u2019s vast expanse is a mere child\u2019s play to it | The story of Man\u2019s failure is known to it by heart\nThis traveler is going to his destination since eternity | Seeing revolutions\u2019 spectacles from the sky\u2019s seclusion\nThough quiescence of the star is not possible in the universe | It has stopped momentarily for saying prayer for the dead\nThis earth is full of flowers of life\u2019s variegations | This earth is the cemetery of many destroyed civilizations\nThis grief-stricken stage is the resting place of kings | O admonished eye ! Pay the tribute of rosy tears\nThough a mere cemetery, this dust ranks with the sky | Ah ! this is the wealth of an unfortunate nation!\nSo astounding is the grandeur of mausoleums | That the spectator\u2019s eye evades even winking\nSuch an expression of failure is in this picture | Which is impossible to reflect in description\u2019s mirror\nFar from the habitations\u2019 crowds are sleeping | Those who were restless with unfulfilled Longings\nThe grave\u2019s darkness holds the brilliance of those suns | At whose thresholds the sky used to remain prostrating\nIs this the end of these emperors\u2019 magnificence? | Whose diplomatic policies knew no decline\nBe it the grandeur of Qaisar or Faghfur\u2019s sway | The foe of death\u2019s assault cannot be turned away\nThe result of kings\u2019 life-efforts also is the grave | The last stage on path of magnificence is the grave\nNeither the happy assembly\u2019s commotion nor the genius\u2019 talk | Not even the wailing people\u2019s whole night\u2019s compassion!\nNeither the tumult of the sword in the battle! | Nor the cry of blood warming Takbar !\nNo call can wake up those who are sleeping | No life can return to the desolate breast\nThe soul in the handful of dust is enduring injustice | When breath enters non-existence\u2019 flute it is a mere complaint\nHuman life resembles the sweet singing bird, which | Sat on the branch a while, chirped, flew away\nAh ! For what purpose did we come in the world, for what purpose did we go away! | Sprouted from the life\u2019s branch, blossomed, faded away\nDeath is interpretation of the dream of the king and the poor alike | This atrocious one\u2019s terror is the picture of justice\nThe stream of life is a boundless ocean | And the grave is a wave of this boundless ocean\nO ambition! Shed tears of blood as this life is unreliable | It is the smile of the spark, it is the flammable straw\nThis moon which is a miracle of the Lord of the universe | Clad in the robe of gold is slowly and proudly strolling\nBut in the frightening vastness of the starless sky | Its helplessness is worth watching at time of dawn\nWhat was the moon is a mere piece of cloud | Whose destruction is in the last tear drop\nSimilarly unpredictable is the life of nations | Their glory is a picture of the happy times gone by\nIn this world no nation however prestigious it may be | Can continue its existence till the end of time\nSo much accustomed to nations\u2019 destruction is the universe | That it watches this scene with indifference\nNothing stays the same without change | The universe\u2019 nature is made of change\nThe beauty of world\u2019s jewel is in ever-changing names | The mother earth has always remained expecting new nations!\nThis highway is acquainted with thousands of caravans | Koh-i-Nur\u2019s eye is familiar with innumerable kings\nEgypt and Babylon are annihilated, not a mark remains | The roll of existence does not have even their names\nThe evening of death has overpowered the sun of Iran | Time has robbed the grandeur of Greece and Rome\nAh! The Muslim also from the world similarly departed | The azar cloud appeared over the horizon, rained and departed\nThe rose petal\u2019s vein is a string of pearls with dawn\u2019s tears | Some ray of the sun is enmeshed in the dew\nThe river\u2019s breast is the cradle for sun\u2019s rays | How beautiful is the sun\u2019s sight at the river bank!\nJuniper is busy in beautifying, river is the mirror | For the flower bud spring breeze is the mirror\nThe cuckoo remains calling from the garden\u2019s nest | Remains hidden from the human eye in the leaves\u2019 privacy\nAnd the nightingale, the flowery singer of the garden | By whose presence is alive the glory of the garden\nIs a living picture of the commotion of Love | How beautiful is this picture from Nature\u2019s pen!\nIn the garden the roses silent assemblies are holding | The shepherd boys\u2019 shouts in the valley are echoing\nThis old world is so full of life | That in death also is hidden the zest of life\nThe petals fall in autumn in the same way | As toys fall from the sleeping infant\u2019s hand\nIn this cheerful world though luxury is limitless | One grief, that is grief of the Millat is always fresh\nMemories of the age gone by are still fresh in our heart | This Ummah cannot erase its kings\u2019 memories form its heart\nThese desolate mansions are excuses for shedding tears | Insight has developed in the eye with continuous tears\nWe give to the world the pearls of the weeping eye | We are the remaining clouds of a storm gone by\nThere are hundreds of pearls in this cloud\u2019s breast | Thunder still lurks in this cloud\u2019s silent breast\nIt can change the dry wilderness to a flowery vale | It can change the farmer\u2019s hope from slumber to awakening\nThe manifestation of this nation\u2019s majesty has passed | But the manifestation of its beauty has not yet passed","poem_id":"","theme":"azar"}

These are (i) universality of Islam, (ii) Mission of the Holy Prophet S.A.W., (iii) Struggle, including fighting, if necessary, in the cause of truth and defense of the weak and the oppressed, (iv) Islamic values. The universality of Islam is evidenced in the Holy Qur\u2019an in which God always calls Himself \u201cRabb-ul-Alaman\u2019\u2019 (Lord of the whole universe and not that of Muslims or of any race or nation). This message is interspersed throughout the Holy Qur\u2019an. It is contained in verses 1, 4, 7 and 8 of the poem. Verse 2 carries the second message which is based on the Holy Qur\u2019an. 9:33\u00ac; 27:91-93; 30:30; 48:8-10, 28\u00ac and 61:9\u00ac, of which the three marked with asterisk are very significant. The third message is very important and is oft repeated in the Holy Qur\u2019an (2:190-193, 216, 244; 4:74-76, 84; 8:39, 65; 9:5, 6, 12-16, 19, 20, 29, 33, 81-85, 123; 22:39-41, 78; 25:52; 29:69; 47:4, 20-21; 48:17, 28 and 61: 9. Verses 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the poem contain this message. The whole Qur\u2019an is the exposition of Islamic values. Verses 2, 3, 10 and 11 of the poem contain this thought. For these reasons the poem is very popular among Muslims and is memorized by young boys and girls.\n\nChina and Arabia are ours, India is also ours | We are Muslims, whole world is homeland of ours\nThe trust of Divine Unity is in the breasts of ours | It is not easy to destroy the identity of ours\nAmong the world\u2019s temples that first House of God | We are its sentinels, it is the sentinel of ours\nWe have been brought up under the shade of swords | The crescent\u2019s dagger is the national insignia of ours\nOur Adhan echoed in the valleys of the West | None could stop the advancing flood of ours\nWe cannot be bowed down by falsehood, O sky | Hundreds of times you have done tests of ours\nO garden of Andalus ! Do you remember the days | When your branches harbored the nest of ours?\nO wave of the Tigris ! You also recognize us | Your river still recites the stories of ours\nO Holy Land ! For your honor we fought to the bitter end | Still flowing in your veins is the blood of ours\nThe Hijaz\u2019s Chief is the commander of our caravan | This name preserves solace of the hearts of ours\nThis anthem of Iqbal is the clarion\u2019s call so to say | Again prepares for the journey the caravan of ours","poem_id":"","theme":"Chief"}

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about Kalimah","output":"Though the decline of the Muslim world and society can be traced back to the replacement of Khilafah-i- Rashidah by the monarchist rule of special dynasties, the last three hundred years have seen the constant fall of the Muslim world, which reached its lowest ebb after the first World War. The latter period witnessed the crumbling down of the last vestiges of the Khilafah and the complete fragmentation and subjugation of the Muslim world by its perpetual adversaries in the Western world. | This deplorable state of affairs touched the hearts of many Muslim intellectuals all over the world, including the Indian sub-continent. These intellectuals started probing into the causes of the decline of Muslims and attempted to devise means of stopping and reversing it. Though these thinkers were richly endowed with Islamic learning and were fully aware of the virtues and blessings of Islam they were unaware of the poisons in the Western thought and society which damaged Muslim society most. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, helped by the unique combination of the deep and profound knowledge of Islam as well as that of the world affairs and Western learning, stands out prominently among Muslim reformers as the one fully conversant with the strengths as well as the weaknesses of the Muslim world. The achievements of the Muslim world in all fields during the first eight centuries of the Islamic era and its ascendancy over Europe are well known. This was the result of some qualities and virtues of the Muslims of those times. When the downfall of the Muslim world started it proceeded unabated till only very recent years when the tide appeared to be turning. Determination of the causes of this degeneration is the sine qua non for Islamic renaissance. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, true to the epithet of Hakam-i-Millat (the Millat\u2019s sage or physician) spent the major part of his genius in investigating the causes of this downfall and in creating the consciousness of the situation in the Muslim mind. In addition to the damage caused by the machinations of the West the Muslim world suffered from their own increasing back-sliding from their original high spiritual, moral and ethical pedestal. The \u2018Allamah took great pains to elaborate these causes in the hope that the Muslim society would use them as the springboard for their revival. Though these thoughts are spread over this entire works in the form of poems and individual verses three long poems in Bang-i-Dara have detailed them. These poems are the present one, \u201cSham\u2018a-o-Sha\u2018ir \u201d (The Candle and the Poet) and \u201cJawab-i-Shakwah\u201d (The Response to the Complaint), also in the same book. The present poem is a complaint to God in which \u2018Allamah Iqbal describes the sacrifices made by the Muslim Ummah in the cause of Islam, as well as their achievements. He pleads that in view of this the present deplorable condition of the Muslim world is unfair. He prays for Divine help to Muslims to improve their condition and get back their old status of prestige and glory. | Though several reputed thinkers and literateurs in the Indian sub-continent and other parts of the Muslim world had earlier attempted to probe into the causes and suggest remedial and corrective measures for the poor condition of the Muslim Ummah \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s two poems, viz Shakwah (The Complaint) and Jawab-i-Shakwah (The Response to the Complaint) stand out as the ones with exquisite literary grandeur and beauty. For this reason it was but natural for them to have special appeal to all Muslims in general and to the Muslims of the Indian sub-continent in particular. The poems did have this effect and made \u2018Allamah Iqbal near and dear to the hearts of the Muslims everywhere. These poems have been translated and molded into music in Urdu as well as other languages including Arabic and important European languages.\n\nWhy should I be destructive and remain reckless of betterment? | Think not of the future, remain occupied in today\u2019s problems?\nShould I hear nightingale\u2019s wails, and remain completely silent? | O companion!

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about sellers","output":"Though the decline of the Muslim world and society can be traced back to the replacement of Khilafah-i- Rashidah by the monarchist rule of special dynasties, the last three hundred years have seen the constant fall of the Muslim world, which reached its lowest ebb after the first World War. The latter period witnessed the crumbling down of the last vestiges of the Khilafah and the complete fragmentation and subjugation of the Muslim world by its perpetual adversaries in the Western world. | This deplorable state of affairs touched the hearts of many Muslim intellectuals all over the world, including the Indian sub-continent. These intellectuals started probing into the causes of the decline of Muslims and attempted to devise means of stopping and reversing it. Though these thinkers were richly endowed with Islamic learning and were fully aware of the virtues and blessings of Islam they were unaware of the poisons in the Western thought and society which damaged Muslim society most. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, helped by the unique combination of the deep and profound knowledge of Islam as well as that of the world affairs and Western learning, stands out prominently among Muslim reformers as the one fully conversant with the strengths as well as the weaknesses of the Muslim world. The achievements of the Muslim world in all fields during the first eight centuries of the Islamic era and its ascendancy over Europe are well known. This was the result of some qualities and virtues of the Muslims of those times. When the downfall of the Muslim world started it proceeded unabated till only very recent years when the tide appeared to be turning. Determination of the causes of this degeneration is the sine qua non for Islamic renaissance. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, true to the epithet of Hakam-i-Millat (the Millat\u2019s sage or physician) spent the major part of his genius in investigating the causes of this downfall and in creating the consciousness of the situation in the Muslim mind. In addition to the damage caused by the machinations of the West the Muslim world suffered from their own increasing back-sliding from their original high spiritual, moral and ethical pedestal. The \u2018Allamah took great pains to elaborate these causes in the hope that the Muslim society would use them as the springboard for their revival. Though these thoughts are spread over this entire works in the form of poems and individual verses three long poems in Bang-i-Dara have detailed them. These poems are the present one, \u201cSham\u2018a-o-Sha\u2018ir \u201d (The Candle and the Poet) and \u201cJawab-i-Shakwah\u201d (The Response to the Complaint), also in the same book. The present poem is a complaint to God in which \u2018Allamah Iqbal describes the sacrifices made by the Muslim Ummah in the cause of Islam, as well as their achievements. He pleads that in view of this the present deplorable condition of the Muslim world is unfair. He prays for Divine help to Muslims to improve their condition and get back their old status of prestige and glory. | Though several reputed thinkers and literateurs in the Indian sub-continent and other parts of the Muslim world had earlier attempted to probe into the causes and suggest remedial and corrective measures for the poor condition of the Muslim Ummah \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s two poems, viz Shakwah (The Complaint) and Jawab-i-Shakwah (The Response to the Complaint) stand out as the ones with exquisite literary grandeur and beauty. For this reason it was but natural for them to have special appeal to all Muslims in general and to the Muslims of the Indian sub-continent in particular. The poems did have this effect and made \u2018Allamah Iqbal near and dear to the hearts of the Muslims everywhere. These poems have been translated and molded into music in Urdu as well as other languages including Arabic and important European languages.\n\nWhy should I be destructive and remain reckless of betterment? | Think not of the future, remain occupied in today\u2019s problems?\nShould I hear nightingale\u2019s wails, and remain completely silent? | O companion!

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about Bilal","output":"Though the decline of the Muslim world and society can be traced back to the replacement of Khilafah-i- Rashidah by the monarchist rule of special dynasties, the last three hundred years have seen the constant fall of the Muslim world, which reached its lowest ebb after the first World War. The latter period witnessed the crumbling down of the last vestiges of the Khilafah and the complete fragmentation and subjugation of the Muslim world by its perpetual adversaries in the Western world. | This deplorable state of affairs touched the hearts of many Muslim intellectuals all over the world, including the Indian sub-continent. These intellectuals started probing into the causes of the decline of Muslims and attempted to devise means of stopping and reversing it. Though these thinkers were richly endowed with Islamic learning and were fully aware of the virtues and blessings of Islam they were unaware of the poisons in the Western thought and society which damaged Muslim society most. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, helped by the unique combination of the deep and profound knowledge of Islam as well as that of the world affairs and Western learning, stands out prominently among Muslim reformers as the one fully conversant with the strengths as well as the weaknesses of the Muslim world. The achievements of the Muslim world in all fields during the first eight centuries of the Islamic era and its ascendancy over Europe are well known. This was the result of some qualities and virtues of the Muslims of those times. When the downfall of the Muslim world started it proceeded unabated till only very recent years when the tide appeared to be turning. Determination of the causes of this degeneration is the sine qua non for Islamic renaissance. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, true to the epithet of Hakam-i-Millat (the Millat\u2019s sage or physician) spent the major part of his genius in investigating the causes of this downfall and in creating the consciousness of the situation in the Muslim mind. In addition to the damage caused by the machinations of the West the Muslim world suffered from their own increasing back-sliding from their original high spiritual, moral and ethical pedestal. The \u2018Allamah took great pains to elaborate these causes in the hope that the Muslim society would use them as the springboard for their revival. Though these thoughts are spread over this entire works in the form of poems and individual verses three long poems in Bang-i-Dara have detailed them. These poems are the present one, \u201cSham\u2018a-o-Sha\u2018ir \u201d (The Candle and the Poet) and \u201cJawab-i-Shakwah\u201d (The Response to the Complaint), also in the same book. The present poem is a complaint to God in which \u2018Allamah Iqbal describes the sacrifices made by the Muslim Ummah in the cause of Islam, as well as their achievements. He pleads that in view of this the present deplorable condition of the Muslim world is unfair. He prays for Divine help to Muslims to improve their condition and get back their old status of prestige and glory. | Though several reputed thinkers and literateurs in the Indian sub-continent and other parts of the Muslim world had earlier attempted to probe into the causes and suggest remedial and corrective measures for the poor condition of the Muslim Ummah \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s two poems, viz Shakwah (The Complaint) and Jawab-i-Shakwah (The Response to the Complaint) stand out as the ones with exquisite literary grandeur and beauty. For this reason it was but natural for them to have special appeal to all Muslims in general and to the Muslims of the Indian sub-continent in particular. The poems did have this effect and made \u2018Allamah Iqbal near and dear to the hearts of the Muslims everywhere.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about ocean","output":"Though the decline of the Muslim world and society can be traced back to the replacement of Khilafah-i- Rashidah by the monarchist rule of special dynasties, the last three hundred years have seen the constant fall of the Muslim world, which reached its lowest ebb after the first World War. The latter period witnessed the crumbling down of the last vestiges of the Khilafah and the complete fragmentation and subjugation of the Muslim world by its perpetual adversaries in the Western world. | This deplorable state of affairs touched the hearts of many Muslim intellectuals all over the world, including the Indian sub-continent. These intellectuals started probing into the causes of the decline of Muslims and attempted to devise means of stopping and reversing it. Though these thinkers were richly endowed with Islamic learning and were fully aware of the virtues and blessings of Islam they were unaware of the poisons in the Western thought and society which damaged Muslim society most. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, helped by the unique combination of the deep and profound knowledge of Islam as well as that of the world affairs and Western learning, stands out prominently among Muslim reformers as the one fully conversant with the strengths as well as the weaknesses of the Muslim world. The achievements of the Muslim world in all fields during the first eight centuries of the Islamic era and its ascendancy over Europe are well known. This was the result of some qualities and virtues of the Muslims of those times. When the downfall of the Muslim world started it proceeded unabated till only very recent years when the tide appeared to be turning. Determination of the causes of this degeneration is the sine qua non for Islamic renaissance. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, true to the epithet of Hakam-i-Millat (the Millat\u2019s sage or physician) spent the major part of his genius in investigating the causes of this downfall and in creating the consciousness of the situation in the Muslim mind. In addition to the damage caused by the machinations of the West the Muslim world suffered from their own increasing back-sliding from their original high spiritual, moral and ethical pedestal. The \u2018Allamah took great pains to elaborate these causes in the hope that the Muslim society would use them as the springboard for their revival. Though these thoughts are spread over this entire works in the form of poems and individual verses three long poems in Bang-i-Dara have detailed them. These poems are the present one, \u201cSham\u2018a-o-Sha\u2018ir \u201d (The Candle and the Poet) and \u201cJawab-i-Shakwah\u201d (The Response to the Complaint), also in the same book. The present poem is a complaint to God in which \u2018Allamah Iqbal describes the sacrifices made by the Muslim Ummah in the cause of Islam, as well as their achievements. He pleads that in view of this the present deplorable condition of the Muslim world is unfair. He prays for Divine help to Muslims to improve their condition and get back their old status of prestige and glory. | Though several reputed thinkers and literateurs in the Indian sub-continent and other parts of the Muslim world had earlier attempted to probe into the causes and suggest remedial and corrective measures for the poor condition of the Muslim Ummah \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s two poems, viz Shakwah (The Complaint) and Jawab-i-Shakwah (The Response to the Complaint) stand out as the ones with exquisite literary grandeur and beauty. For this reason it was but natural for them to have special appeal to all Muslims in general and to the Muslims of the Indian sub-continent in particular. The poems did have this effect and made \u2018Allamah Iqbal near and dear to the hearts of the Muslims everywhere.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about Yazdan","output":"Though the decline of the Muslim world and society can be traced back to the replacement of Khilafah-i- Rashidah by the monarchist rule of special dynasties, the last three hundred years have seen the constant fall of the Muslim world, which reached its lowest ebb after the first World War. The latter period witnessed the crumbling down of the last vestiges of the Khilafah and the complete fragmentation and subjugation of the Muslim world by its perpetual adversaries in the Western world. | This deplorable state of affairs touched the hearts of many Muslim intellectuals all over the world, including the Indian sub-continent. These intellectuals started probing into the causes of the decline of Muslims and attempted to devise means of stopping and reversing it. Though these thinkers were richly endowed with Islamic learning and were fully aware of the virtues and blessings of Islam they were unaware of the poisons in the Western thought and society which damaged Muslim society most. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, helped by the unique combination of the deep and profound knowledge of Islam as well as that of the world affairs and Western learning, stands out prominently among Muslim reformers as the one fully conversant with the strengths as well as the weaknesses of the Muslim world. The achievements of the Muslim world in all fields during the first eight centuries of the Islamic era and its ascendancy over Europe are well known. This was the result of some qualities and virtues of the Muslims of those times. When the downfall of the Muslim world started it proceeded unabated till only very recent years when the tide appeared to be turning. Determination of the causes of this degeneration is the sine qua non for Islamic renaissance. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, true to the epithet of Hakam-i-Millat (the Millat\u2019s sage or physician) spent the major part of his genius in investigating the causes of this downfall and in creating the consciousness of the situation in the Muslim mind. In addition to the damage caused by the machinations of the West the Muslim world suffered from their own increasing back-sliding from their original high spiritual, moral and ethical pedestal. The \u2018Allamah took great pains to elaborate these causes in the hope that the Muslim society would use them as the springboard for their revival. Though these thoughts are spread over this entire works in the form of poems and individual verses three long poems in Bang-i-Dara have detailed them. These poems are the present one, \u201cSham\u2018a-o-Sha\u2018ir \u201d (The Candle and the Poet) and \u201cJawab-i-Shakwah\u201d (The Response to the Complaint), also in the same book. The present poem is a complaint to God in which \u2018Allamah Iqbal describes the sacrifices made by the Muslim Ummah in the cause of Islam, as well as their achievements. He pleads that in view of this the present deplorable condition of the Muslim world is unfair. He prays for Divine help to Muslims to improve their condition and get back their old status of prestige and glory. | Though several reputed thinkers and literateurs in the Indian sub-continent and other parts of the Muslim world had earlier attempted to probe into the causes and suggest remedial and corrective measures for the poor condition of the Muslim Ummah \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s two poems, viz Shakwah (The Complaint) and Jawab-i-Shakwah (The Response to the Complaint) stand out as the ones with exquisite literary grandeur and beauty. For this reason it was but natural for them to have special appeal to all Muslims in general and to the Muslims of the Indian sub-continent in particular. The poems did have this effect and made \u2018Allamah Iqbal near and dear to the hearts of the Muslims everywhere.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about still","output":"Though the decline of the Muslim world and society can be traced back to the replacement of Khilafah-i- Rashidah by the monarchist rule of special dynasties, the last three hundred years have seen the constant fall of the Muslim world, which reached its lowest ebb after the first World War. The latter period witnessed the crumbling down of the last vestiges of the Khilafah and the complete fragmentation and subjugation of the Muslim world by its perpetual adversaries in the Western world. | This deplorable state of affairs touched the hearts of many Muslim intellectuals all over the world, including the Indian sub-continent. These intellectuals started probing into the causes of the decline of Muslims and attempted to devise means of stopping and reversing it. Though these thinkers were richly endowed with Islamic learning and were fully aware of the virtues and blessings of Islam they were unaware of the poisons in the Western thought and society which damaged Muslim society most. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, helped by the unique combination of the deep and profound knowledge of Islam as well as that of the world affairs and Western learning, stands out prominently among Muslim reformers as the one fully conversant with the strengths as well as the weaknesses of the Muslim world. The achievements of the Muslim world in all fields during the first eight centuries of the Islamic era and its ascendancy over Europe are well known. This was the result of some qualities and virtues of the Muslims of those times. When the downfall of the Muslim world started it proceeded unabated till only very recent years when the tide appeared to be turning. Determination of the causes of this degeneration is the sine qua non for Islamic renaissance. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, true to the epithet of Hakam-i-Millat (the Millat\u2019s sage or physician) spent the major part of his genius in investigating the causes of this downfall and in creating the consciousness of the situation in the Muslim mind. In addition to the damage caused by the machinations of the West the Muslim world suffered from their own increasing back-sliding from their original high spiritual, moral and ethical pedestal. The \u2018Allamah took great pains to elaborate these causes in the hope that the Muslim society would use them as the springboard for their revival. Though these thoughts are spread over this entire works in the form of poems and individual verses three long poems in Bang-i-Dara have detailed them. These poems are the present one, \u201cSham\u2018a-o-Sha\u2018ir \u201d (The Candle and the Poet) and \u201cJawab-i-Shakwah\u201d (The Response to the Complaint), also in the same book. The present poem is a complaint to God in which \u2018Allamah Iqbal describes the sacrifices made by the Muslim Ummah in the cause of Islam, as well as their achievements. He pleads that in view of this the present deplorable condition of the Muslim world is unfair. He prays for Divine help to Muslims to improve their condition and get back their old status of prestige and glory. | Though several reputed thinkers and literateurs in the Indian sub-continent and other parts of the Muslim world had earlier attempted to probe into the causes and suggest remedial and corrective measures for the poor condition of the Muslim Ummah \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s two poems, viz Shakwah (The Complaint) and Jawab-i-Shakwah (The Response to the Complaint) stand out as the ones with exquisite literary grandeur and beauty. For this reason it was but natural for them to have special appeal to all Muslims in general and to the Muslims of the Indian sub-continent in particular. The poems did have this effect and made \u2018Allamah Iqbal near and dear to the hearts of the Muslims everywhere.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about Sasanas","output":"Though the decline of the Muslim world and society can be traced back to the replacement of Khilafah-i- Rashidah by the monarchist rule of special dynasties, the last three hundred years have seen the constant fall of the Muslim world, which reached its lowest ebb after the first World War. The latter period witnessed the crumbling down of the last vestiges of the Khilafah and the complete fragmentation and subjugation of the Muslim world by its perpetual adversaries in the Western world. | This deplorable state of affairs touched the hearts of many Muslim intellectuals all over the world, including the Indian sub-continent. These intellectuals started probing into the causes of the decline of Muslims and attempted to devise means of stopping and reversing it. Though these thinkers were richly endowed with Islamic learning and were fully aware of the virtues and blessings of Islam they were unaware of the poisons in the Western thought and society which damaged Muslim society most. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, helped by the unique combination of the deep and profound knowledge of Islam as well as that of the world affairs and Western learning, stands out prominently among Muslim reformers as the one fully conversant with the strengths as well as the weaknesses of the Muslim world. The achievements of the Muslim world in all fields during the first eight centuries of the Islamic era and its ascendancy over Europe are well known. This was the result of some qualities and virtues of the Muslims of those times. When the downfall of the Muslim world started it proceeded unabated till only very recent years when the tide appeared to be turning. Determination of the causes of this degeneration is the sine qua non for Islamic renaissance. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, true to the epithet of Hakam-i-Millat (the Millat\u2019s sage or physician) spent the major part of his genius in investigating the causes of this downfall and in creating the consciousness of the situation in the Muslim mind. In addition to the damage caused by the machinations of the West the Muslim world suffered from their own increasing back-sliding from their original high spiritual, moral and ethical pedestal. The \u2018Allamah took great pains to elaborate these causes in the hope that the Muslim society would use them as the springboard for their revival. Though these thoughts are spread over this entire works in the form of poems and individual verses three long poems in Bang-i-Dara have detailed them. These poems are the present one, \u201cSham\u2018a-o-Sha\u2018ir \u201d (The Candle and the Poet) and \u201cJawab-i-Shakwah\u201d (The Response to the Complaint), also in the same book. The present poem is a complaint to God in which \u2018Allamah Iqbal describes the sacrifices made by the Muslim Ummah in the cause of Islam, as well as their achievements. He pleads that in view of this the present deplorable condition of the Muslim world is unfair. He prays for Divine help to Muslims to improve their condition and get back their old status of prestige and glory. | Though several reputed thinkers and literateurs in the Indian sub-continent and other parts of the Muslim world had earlier attempted to probe into the causes and suggest remedial and corrective measures for the poor condition of the Muslim Ummah \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s two poems, viz Shakwah (The Complaint) and Jawab-i-Shakwah (The Response to the Complaint) stand out as the ones with exquisite literary grandeur and beauty. For this reason it was but natural for them to have special appeal to all Muslims in general and to the Muslims of the Indian sub-continent in particular. The poems did have this effect and made \u2018Allamah Iqbal near and dear to the hearts of the Muslims everywhere.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about Saljuqs","output":"Though the decline of the Muslim world and society can be traced back to the replacement of Khilafah-i- Rashidah by the monarchist rule of special dynasties, the last three hundred years have seen the constant fall of the Muslim world, which reached its lowest ebb after the first World War. The latter period witnessed the crumbling down of the last vestiges of the Khilafah and the complete fragmentation and subjugation of the Muslim world by its perpetual adversaries in the Western world. | This deplorable state of affairs touched the hearts of many Muslim intellectuals all over the world, including the Indian sub-continent. These intellectuals started probing into the causes of the decline of Muslims and attempted to devise means of stopping and reversing it. Though these thinkers were richly endowed with Islamic learning and were fully aware of the virtues and blessings of Islam they were unaware of the poisons in the Western thought and society which damaged Muslim society most. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, helped by the unique combination of the deep and profound knowledge of Islam as well as that of the world affairs and Western learning, stands out prominently among Muslim reformers as the one fully conversant with the strengths as well as the weaknesses of the Muslim world. The achievements of the Muslim world in all fields during the first eight centuries of the Islamic era and its ascendancy over Europe are well known. This was the result of some qualities and virtues of the Muslims of those times. When the downfall of the Muslim world started it proceeded unabated till only very recent years when the tide appeared to be turning. Determination of the causes of this degeneration is the sine qua non for Islamic renaissance. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, true to the epithet of Hakam-i-Millat (the Millat\u2019s sage or physician) spent the major part of his genius in investigating the causes of this downfall and in creating the consciousness of the situation in the Muslim mind. In addition to the damage caused by the machinations of the West the Muslim world suffered from their own increasing back-sliding from their original high spiritual, moral and ethical pedestal. The \u2018Allamah took great pains to elaborate these causes in the hope that the Muslim society would use them as the springboard for their revival. Though these thoughts are spread over this entire works in the form of poems and individual verses three long poems in Bang-i-Dara have detailed them. These poems are the present one, \u201cSham\u2018a-o-Sha\u2018ir \u201d (The Candle and the Poet) and \u201cJawab-i-Shakwah\u201d (The Response to the Complaint), also in the same book. The present poem is a complaint to God in which \u2018Allamah Iqbal describes the sacrifices made by the Muslim Ummah in the cause of Islam, as well as their achievements. He pleads that in view of this the present deplorable condition of the Muslim world is unfair. He prays for Divine help to Muslims to improve their condition and get back their old status of prestige and glory. | Though several reputed thinkers and literateurs in the Indian sub-continent and other parts of the Muslim world had earlier attempted to probe into the causes and suggest remedial and corrective measures for the poor condition of the Muslim Ummah \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s two poems, viz Shakwah (The Complaint) and Jawab-i-Shakwah (The Response to the Complaint) stand out as the ones with exquisite literary grandeur and beauty. For this reason it was but natural for them to have special appeal to all Muslims in general and to the Muslims of the Indian sub-continent in particular. The poems did have this effect and made \u2018Allamah Iqbal near and dear to the hearts of the Muslims everywhere.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about Turanas","output":"Though the decline of the Muslim world and society can be traced back to the replacement of Khilafah-i- Rashidah by the monarchist rule of special dynasties, the last three hundred years have seen the constant fall of the Muslim world, which reached its lowest ebb after the first World War. The latter period witnessed the crumbling down of the last vestiges of the Khilafah and the complete fragmentation and subjugation of the Muslim world by its perpetual adversaries in the Western world. | This deplorable state of affairs touched the hearts of many Muslim intellectuals all over the world, including the Indian sub-continent. These intellectuals started probing into the causes of the decline of Muslims and attempted to devise means of stopping and reversing it. Though these thinkers were richly endowed with Islamic learning and were fully aware of the virtues and blessings of Islam they were unaware of the poisons in the Western thought and society which damaged Muslim society most. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, helped by the unique combination of the deep and profound knowledge of Islam as well as that of the world affairs and Western learning, stands out prominently among Muslim reformers as the one fully conversant with the strengths as well as the weaknesses of the Muslim world. The achievements of the Muslim world in all fields during the first eight centuries of the Islamic era and its ascendancy over Europe are well known. This was the result of some qualities and virtues of the Muslims of those times. When the downfall of the Muslim world started it proceeded unabated till only very recent years when the tide appeared to be turning. Determination of the causes of this degeneration is the sine qua non for Islamic renaissance. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, true to the epithet of Hakam-i-Millat (the Millat\u2019s sage or physician) spent the major part of his genius in investigating the causes of this downfall and in creating the consciousness of the situation in the Muslim mind. In addition to the damage caused by the machinations of the West the Muslim world suffered from their own increasing back-sliding from their original high spiritual, moral and ethical pedestal. The \u2018Allamah took great pains to elaborate these causes in the hope that the Muslim society would use them as the springboard for their revival. Though these thoughts are spread over this entire works in the form of poems and individual verses three long poems in Bang-i-Dara have detailed them. These poems are the present one, \u201cSham\u2018a-o-Sha\u2018ir \u201d (The Candle and the Poet) and \u201cJawab-i-Shakwah\u201d (The Response to the Complaint), also in the same book. The present poem is a complaint to God in which \u2018Allamah Iqbal describes the sacrifices made by the Muslim Ummah in the cause of Islam, as well as their achievements. He pleads that in view of this the present deplorable condition of the Muslim world is unfair. He prays for Divine help to Muslims to improve their condition and get back their old status of prestige and glory. | Though several reputed thinkers and literateurs in the Indian sub-continent and other parts of the Muslim world had earlier attempted to probe into the causes and suggest remedial and corrective measures for the poor condition of the Muslim Ummah \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s two poems, viz Shakwah (The Complaint) and Jawab-i-Shakwah (The Response to the Complaint) stand out as the ones with exquisite literary grandeur and beauty. For this reason it was but natural for them to have special appeal to all Muslims in general and to the Muslims of the Indian sub-continent in particular. The poems did have this effect and made \u2018Allamah Iqbal near and dear to the hearts of the Muslims everywhere.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about Salman","output":"Though the decline of the Muslim world and society can be traced back to the replacement of Khilafah-i- Rashidah by the monarchist rule of special dynasties, the last three hundred years have seen the constant fall of the Muslim world, which reached its lowest ebb after the first World War. The latter period witnessed the crumbling down of the last vestiges of the Khilafah and the complete fragmentation and subjugation of the Muslim world by its perpetual adversaries in the Western world. | This deplorable state of affairs touched the hearts of many Muslim intellectuals all over the world, including the Indian sub-continent. These intellectuals started probing into the causes of the decline of Muslims and attempted to devise means of stopping and reversing it. Though these thinkers were richly endowed with Islamic learning and were fully aware of the virtues and blessings of Islam they were unaware of the poisons in the Western thought and society which damaged Muslim society most. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, helped by the unique combination of the deep and profound knowledge of Islam as well as that of the world affairs and Western learning, stands out prominently among Muslim reformers as the one fully conversant with the strengths as well as the weaknesses of the Muslim world. The achievements of the Muslim world in all fields during the first eight centuries of the Islamic era and its ascendancy over Europe are well known. This was the result of some qualities and virtues of the Muslims of those times. When the downfall of the Muslim world started it proceeded unabated till only very recent years when the tide appeared to be turning. Determination of the causes of this degeneration is the sine qua non for Islamic renaissance. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, true to the epithet of Hakam-i-Millat (the Millat\u2019s sage or physician) spent the major part of his genius in investigating the causes of this downfall and in creating the consciousness of the situation in the Muslim mind. In addition to the damage caused by the machinations of the West the Muslim world suffered from their own increasing back-sliding from their original high spiritual, moral and ethical pedestal. The \u2018Allamah took great pains to elaborate these causes in the hope that the Muslim society would use them as the springboard for their revival. Though these thoughts are spread over this entire works in the form of poems and individual verses three long poems in Bang-i-Dara have detailed them. These poems are the present one, \u201cSham\u2018a-o-Sha\u2018ir \u201d (The Candle and the Poet) and \u201cJawab-i-Shakwah\u201d (The Response to the Complaint), also in the same book. The present poem is a complaint to God in which \u2018Allamah Iqbal describes the sacrifices made by the Muslim Ummah in the cause of Islam, as well as their achievements. He pleads that in view of this the present deplorable condition of the Muslim world is unfair. He prays for Divine help to Muslims to improve their condition and get back their old status of prestige and glory. | Though several reputed thinkers and literateurs in the Indian sub-continent and other parts of the Muslim world had earlier attempted to probe into the causes and suggest remedial and corrective measures for the poor condition of the Muslim Ummah \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s two poems, viz Shakwah (The Complaint) and Jawab-i-Shakwah (The Response to the Complaint) stand out as the ones with exquisite literary grandeur and beauty. For this reason it was but natural for them to have special appeal to all Muslims in general and to the Muslims of the Indian sub-continent in particular. The poems did have this effect and made \u2018Allamah Iqbal near and dear to the hearts of the Muslims everywhere.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about Qur\u2019an","output":"Though the decline of the Muslim world and society can be traced back to the replacement of Khilafah-i- Rashidah by the monarchist rule of special dynasties, the last three hundred years have seen the constant fall of the Muslim world, which reached its lowest ebb after the first World War. The latter period witnessed the crumbling down of the last vestiges of the Khilafah and the complete fragmentation and subjugation of the Muslim world by its perpetual adversaries in the Western world. | This deplorable state of affairs touched the hearts of many Muslim intellectuals all over the world, including the Indian sub-continent. These intellectuals started probing into the causes of the decline of Muslims and attempted to devise means of stopping and reversing it. Though these thinkers were richly endowed with Islamic learning and were fully aware of the virtues and blessings of Islam they were unaware of the poisons in the Western thought and society which damaged Muslim society most. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, helped by the unique combination of the deep and profound knowledge of Islam as well as that of the world affairs and Western learning, stands out prominently among Muslim reformers as the one fully conversant with the strengths as well as the weaknesses of the Muslim world. The achievements of the Muslim world in all fields during the first eight centuries of the Islamic era and its ascendancy over Europe are well known. This was the result of some qualities and virtues of the Muslims of those times. When the downfall of the Muslim world started it proceeded unabated till only very recent years when the tide appeared to be turning. Determination of the causes of this degeneration is the sine qua non for Islamic renaissance. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, true to the epithet of Hakam-i-Millat (the Millat\u2019s sage or physician) spent the major part of his genius in investigating the causes of this downfall and in creating the consciousness of the situation in the Muslim mind. In addition to the damage caused by the machinations of the West the Muslim world suffered from their own increasing back-sliding from their original high spiritual, moral and ethical pedestal. The \u2018Allamah took great pains to elaborate these causes in the hope that the Muslim society would use them as the springboard for their revival. Though these thoughts are spread over this entire works in the form of poems and individual verses three long poems in Bang-i-Dara have detailed them. These poems are the present one, \u201cSham\u2018a-o-Sha\u2018ir \u201d (The Candle and the Poet) and \u201cJawab-i-Shakwah\u201d (The Response to the Complaint), also in the same book. The present poem is a complaint to God in which \u2018Allamah Iqbal describes the sacrifices made by the Muslim Ummah in the cause of Islam, as well as their achievements. He pleads that in view of this the present deplorable condition of the Muslim world is unfair. He prays for Divine help to Muslims to improve their condition and get back their old status of prestige and glory. | Though several reputed thinkers and literateurs in the Indian sub-continent and other parts of the Muslim world had earlier attempted to probe into the causes and suggest remedial and corrective measures for the poor condition of the Muslim Ummah \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s two poems, viz Shakwah (The Complaint) and Jawab-i-Shakwah (The Response to the Complaint) stand out as the ones with exquisite literary grandeur and beauty. For this reason it was but natural for them to have special appeal to all Muslims in general and to the Muslims of the Indian sub-continent in particular. The poems did have this effect and made \u2018Allamah Iqbal near and dear to the hearts of the Muslims everywhere.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about lamp","output":"Though the decline of the Muslim world and society can be traced back to the replacement of Khilafah-i- Rashidah by the monarchist rule of special dynasties, the last three hundred years have seen the constant fall of the Muslim world, which reached its lowest ebb after the first World War. The latter period witnessed the crumbling down of the last vestiges of the Khilafah and the complete fragmentation and subjugation of the Muslim world by its perpetual adversaries in the Western world. | This deplorable state of affairs touched the hearts of many Muslim intellectuals all over the world, including the Indian sub-continent. These intellectuals started probing into the causes of the decline of Muslims and attempted to devise means of stopping and reversing it. Though these thinkers were richly endowed with Islamic learning and were fully aware of the virtues and blessings of Islam they were unaware of the poisons in the Western thought and society which damaged Muslim society most. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, helped by the unique combination of the deep and profound knowledge of Islam as well as that of the world affairs and Western learning, stands out prominently among Muslim reformers as the one fully conversant with the strengths as well as the weaknesses of the Muslim world. The achievements of the Muslim world in all fields during the first eight centuries of the Islamic era and its ascendancy over Europe are well known. This was the result of some qualities and virtues of the Muslims of those times. When the downfall of the Muslim world started it proceeded unabated till only very recent years when the tide appeared to be turning. Determination of the causes of this degeneration is the sine qua non for Islamic renaissance. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, true to the epithet of Hakam-i-Millat (the Millat\u2019s sage or physician) spent the major part of his genius in investigating the causes of this downfall and in creating the consciousness of the situation in the Muslim mind. In addition to the damage caused by the machinations of the West the Muslim world suffered from their own increasing back-sliding from their original high spiritual, moral and ethical pedestal. The \u2018Allamah took great pains to elaborate these causes in the hope that the Muslim society would use them as the springboard for their revival. Though these thoughts are spread over this entire works in the form of poems and individual verses three long poems in Bang-i-Dara have detailed them. These poems are the present one, \u201cSham\u2018a-o-Sha\u2018ir \u201d (The Candle and the Poet) and \u201cJawab-i-Shakwah\u201d (The Response to the Complaint), also in the same book. The present poem is a complaint to God in which \u2018Allamah Iqbal describes the sacrifices made by the Muslim Ummah in the cause of Islam, as well as their achievements. He pleads that in view of this the present deplorable condition of the Muslim world is unfair. He prays for Divine help to Muslims to improve their condition and get back their old status of prestige and glory. | Though several reputed thinkers and literateurs in the Indian sub-continent and other parts of the Muslim world had earlier attempted to probe into the causes and suggest remedial and corrective measures for the poor condition of the Muslim Ummah \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s two poems, viz Shakwah (The Complaint) and Jawab-i-Shakwah (The Response to the Complaint) stand out as the ones with exquisite literary grandeur and beauty. For this reason it was but natural for them to have special appeal to all Muslims in general and to the Muslims of the Indian sub-continent in particular. The poems did have this effect and made \u2018Allamah Iqbal near and dear to the hearts of the Muslims everywhere. These poems have been translated and molded into music in Urdu as well as other languages including Arabic and important European languages.\n\nWhy should I be destructive and remain reckless of betterment? | Think not of the future, remain occupied in today\u2019s problems?\nShould I hear nightingale\u2019s wails, and remain completely silent? | O companion!

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about sanctuary","output":"This short poem contains two concepts, i.e. those of the relationship between Love of God and His `ibadah and the other is the theory of Wahdat-al-Shuhud. The first one is contained in the first three verses and states that Love of God and His \u2018ibadah are inseparable from each other. `Ibadah is meaningless without His Love and the culmination of love is His real \u2018Ibadah (in the board sense). This is supported by the Holy Qur\u2019an of which six references have been selected. The whole of Surah 55, (Al Rahman) is full of one of the most beautiful literary pieces in which the signs of God in the Afaq are enumerated on the basis of which appeal is made to Man to Love and worship Him in the broad sense. The opening verses of Surahs 57, 59 and 61 command all creation to sing His Praises as an expression of their Love for Him. Similarly the opening verses of Surahs 62 and 64 state that al creation does in fact sing His praises as an expression of their ardent Love for Him. For more details of `ibadah.\n\nO moon!

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about collars","output":"This is one of the series of long poems starting with poem 88, Shakwah (The Complaint). As explained in the introduction to that poem this series of poems deals with the rise, glory, achievements, decline and fall of the Muslim world. As stated earlier this subject was the one dearest to \u2018Allamah Iqbal and perhaps the raison d`etre of his works. In Shakwah the emphasis is on the services and achievements of the early Muslims in the cause of Islam and God. In the present poem the field has widened. The poem is an allegory describing a conversation with the candle. The poet himself represents an average Muslim leader, spiritual as well as secular. He starts with asking the candle the reason for its effectiveness in creating its love in the moth and the one for his own ineptitude in the field of influencing his own circle. The candle states the reason to be its own sincerity and the lack of it in the leaders. The main cause of the present deplorable condition of the Muslim Ummah is its distancing itself from the Holy Qur\u2019an and Islamic values. The recent efforts at reform are inadequate as well as too late. However, like other works of \u2018Allamah Iqbal, in this poem also the state of his frustration is not permanent. The candle gives the message of hope and points out that the Muslim Ummah is waking up to its responsibilities and is starting to face its adversaries with the help of the Holy Qur\u2019an.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about insane","output":"This is one of the series of long poems starting with poem 88, Shakwah (The Complaint). As explained in the introduction to that poem this series of poems deals with the rise, glory, achievements, decline and fall of the Muslim world. As stated earlier this subject was the one dearest to \u2018Allamah Iqbal and perhaps the raison d`etre of his works. In Shakwah the emphasis is on the services and achievements of the early Muslims in the cause of Islam and God. In the present poem the field has widened. The poem is an allegory describing a conversation with the candle. The poet himself represents an average Muslim leader, spiritual as well as secular. He starts with asking the candle the reason for its effectiveness in creating its love in the moth and the one for his own ineptitude in the field of influencing his own circle. The candle states the reason to be its own sincerity and the lack of it in the leaders. The main cause of the present deplorable condition of the Muslim Ummah is its distancing itself from the Holy Qur\u2019an and Islamic values. The recent efforts at reform are inadequate as well as too late. However, like other works of \u2018Allamah Iqbal, in this poem also the state of his frustration is not permanent. The candle gives the message of hope and points out that the Muslim Ummah is waking up to its responsibilities and is starting to face its adversaries with the help of the Holy Qur\u2019an. The great potential of the Ummah is described in detail and the poem ends with firm hope and promise of success for the Ummah and defeat of our enemies and their value system.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about Kalam","output":"This is one of the series of long poems starting with poem 88, Shakwah (The Complaint). As explained in the introduction to that poem this series of poems deals with the rise, glory, achievements, decline and fall of the Muslim world. As stated earlier this subject was the one dearest to \u2018Allamah Iqbal and perhaps the raison d`etre of his works. In Shakwah the emphasis is on the services and achievements of the early Muslims in the cause of Islam and God. In the present poem the field has widened. The poem is an allegory describing a conversation with the candle. The poet himself represents an average Muslim leader, spiritual as well as secular. He starts with asking the candle the reason for its effectiveness in creating its love in the moth and the one for his own ineptitude in the field of influencing his own circle. The candle states the reason to be its own sincerity and the lack of it in the leaders. The main cause of the present deplorable condition of the Muslim Ummah is its distancing itself from the Holy Qur\u2019an and Islamic values. The recent efforts at reform are inadequate as well as too late. However, like other works of \u2018Allamah Iqbal, in this poem also the state of his frustration is not permanent. The candle gives the message of hope and points out that the Muslim Ummah is waking up to its responsibilities and is starting to face its adversaries with the help of the Holy Qur\u2019an. The great potential of the Ummah is described in detail and the poem ends with firm hope and promise of success for the Ummah and defeat of our enemies and their value system. The climax is reached in the last verse.\n\nThe Poet\nLast night I said to the candle of my desolate house | \u201cYour hair gets combed by the wings of the moth\nIn the world I am like the lamp of the wilderness\u2019 tulip | I am neither in an assembly\u2019s lot, nor in a house\u2019 fortune\nSince a long time I am also burning my breath like you | Though I am circling the flame no moth has hit its wing\nMany an effulgence is crammed in my life of unfulfilled desires | Not a single loving heart rises in this assembly\nFrom where have you acquired this world-illuminating fire? | You have infused the love of Kalam in the poor insect\u201d !\nThe Candle\n\u201cThe blow of breath which gives me the message of death | By the same blow of breath your lip is melodious\nI am alight because burning is built into my nature | You are alight so that the moths may have the love of yours\nI am weeping because a flood gushes forth from my heart | You shed dew so that garden\u2019s assembly may sing praises yours\nMy morning is adorned with the roses from my night\u2019s toil | Your tomorrow is unaware of the today of yours\nThough you are lightened your are devoid of the inner heat | Like the lamp of the wilderness\u2019 tulip is the flame of yours\nJust think if cup-bearer\u2019s title is appropriate for you | Assembly is thirsty and the wine-measure is empty of yours\nYour ways are different, the law of the Millat is different | Your mirror has been disgraced by the ugly appearance of yours\nWith the Ka\u2018bah by your side you are temple\u2019s lover | How rebellious is the irresponsible love of yours\nThat Qais be produced in your assembly is not possible | Your wilderness is straitened, without Lailah is the litter of yours\nO brilliant pearl ! O the one reared in the wave\u2019s lap | Unacquainted with the taste of storms is the ocean of yours\nWhy are you singing now? your garden is in disorder! | Your singing is out of place, your music is out of season\nThose who were anxious for the Spectacle have departed | Your coming now with general Sighting\u2019s promise matters little\nThose old ardent lovers of wine are gone from the assembly | O cub-bearer ! Your coming now in assembly with strong wine in the cup matters little\nAh ! When the rose garden\u2019s organization has already got disorganized | If the flower got the message of spring breeze matters little\nThe lover\u2019s condition was worth seeing at the night\u2019s end | The Beloved\u2019s arrival early in the morning matters little\nExtinguished is the flame which was every moth\u2019s objective | If some pursuer of perfect love came now it matters little\nThe flowers do not care, you may or may not sing | The caravan is callous, the bell may or may not ring\nIf devoid of love\u2019s warmth you remained even as assembly\u2019s candle | Your moths also unacquainted with this taste remained\nIf you could string them together on the thread of Love | Then why did the beads of your rosary scattered remain?\nGone is the courageous Love, gone is the sublime thinking | In your assembly neither the insane nor the sages remain\nGone is that burning of Love, gone is that heart\u2019s pathos | What good it is if the moths round the candle did remain?\nVery well, the cup-bearer you may be, whom will you serve wine | Now neither those wine-drinkers nor those taverns did remain\nToday a broken decanter is crying for the cup-bearer | Whose goblets in circulation till yesterday did remain\nToday are silent those Love-cherishing expanses | Where Lailah and her lovers dancing did remain\nHow disappointing ! The caravan\u2019s wealth is gone | The feeling of loss from caravan\u2019s heart is gone\nWith whose activities the wilderness was once flourishing | Their cities are wiped out, habitations desolate have became\nThe prayers which established the grandeur of Tawhad | Those prayers offerings to Brahman in India have become\nIn this world ever-lasting comfort on laws\u2019 observance depends | To the ocean wave freedoms prelude to lamentation have become\nThe Manifestation Itself was longing for whose eyes | Those eyes despaired of Aiman\u2019s light have become\nThousands of nightingales were flying about in the rose-garden | What happened to them that they confined to the nests have become ?\nIn the celestial expanse whose lightning power was panoramic | Those lightning\u2019s satiated with the barn\u2019s sides have become\nWhy should the blood letting eye ingratiated to the rose garden be ? | With continuous tears the eyes fully satiated with embers have become\nHowever, the grief\u2019s night gives the message of \u2018Eid\u2019s morning | In the darkness of the night the ray of hope has appeared\nGlad tidings, O cup-bearer of the tavern of Hijaz | After ages your rinds have regained consciousness\nWealth of self-respect was the price for other\u2019s wine | Now your shop is again full of calls for the carousal\nAbout to break is the magic of India\u2019s white faced masters | Again the Sulaima\u2019s eye is the harbinger of clamor\u2019s message\nThere is clamor again for cup-bearer to bring the home-made wine | As the heart\u2019s uproars have been silenced by the West\u2019s wine\nSing because this is not the time for silence | The dawn\u2019s sky is shouldering the sun like decanter\nBurn in sympathy with others and also make others burn | Listen if you can, a bright Hadath has been conveyed to you\nAncestors have said that poetry is a part of prophethood | Yes, convey to the Millat the glad tidings of the Messenger Angel !\nAwaken the eye with the promise of the Beloved\u2019s Sight | Bring the heart to life with the warmth of speech\u2019s skill\nYour love for indulgence became a robber of courage | You were an ocean in wilderness, in garden a brook you became\nWhen you stood firm in your purity, you had the nation also | Caravan of fragrance after leaving the rose scattered became\nThe life of the drop has lessons of the secrets of life | Sometimes pearl, sometimes dew, sometimes tear it became\nObtain it from somewhere it is a great wealth | What good is life if the heart unaware of bosom became\nYour honor depended upon the organization of the Millat | When this organization departed, disgraced world wide you became\nThe individual is firm by nation\u2019s coherence, otherwise nothing | The wave is only in the ocean, and outside it is nothing\nKeep the love concealed in your heart\u2019s veil still | That is do not disgrace your wine like the decanter\nPitch your tent in the Valley of Sinai like Kalam | Make the Truth\u2019s flame destroyer of home\u2019s comfort\nThe candle should also know the result of atrocities | Make the moth\u2019s ashes restorer of the morning\nIf you are self-respecting be not obliged to the cup-bearer | In the ocean\u2019s midst turn the goblet up side down like the bubble\nNo joy remains in the old mountains and wilderness | Your love is new, you should create new wilderness\nIf the destiny has destroyed you completely | From downfall make a new rod like the seed\nYes !@ Build your nest again on the same old branch | Make the rose garden\u2019s residents martyrs of the song of intoxication\nIn this garden be the nightingale\u2019s follower or rose\u2019 pupil | Either be all complaint or do not produce any music\nWhy are you silent in the garden like dew\u2019s retreat | Open your lips, you are the music of the world\u2019s harp!\nBecome somewhat acquainted with your own reality O farmer! | The grain, the cultivation, the rain, as well as the produce you are\nAh ! Whose search keeps you aimlessly wandering | The path, the traveler, the guide, as well as the destination you are\nWhy is your heart trembling with the fear of the storm? | The sailor, the ocean, the boat, as well as the sea-shore you are\nCome and look some time in the lane of the torn collars | Qais, Lailah, the wilderness as well as the litter on the camel you are\nWoe foolishness ! You are in need of the cup-bearer | The wine, the decanter, the cup-bearer, as well as the assembly you are\nBecoming a flame burn down the rubbish of Godlessness | Why are you afraid of the falsehood?

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about offering","output":"This short poem, full of pathos, is the sincere out-pouring of \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s heart-felt grief. It is an allegory of an audience with the Holy Prophet S.A.W. It is usual with \u2018Allamah Iqbal, in common with Khawajah Altaf Hussain Hala to present his feelings to the Holy Prophet (S.A.W) at critical times and to request him for supplication to God to alleviate the situation. This poem was written in 1913 for the immediate problem of the invasion of Libya by Italy, as is indicated by the last verse. However, it also reflects the \u2018Allamah\u2019s feelings on the deplorable condition of the Muslim Ummah throughout the world in the first two decades of the present century. At that time the imperialist countries of Europe were ransacking the whole world, pillaging the natural resources of the defenseless nations of all countries outside Europe. Not stopping there they obliterated the cultures and religions of the vanquished people in the misplaced enthusiasm of making them \u201ccivilized\u201d, and protecting them from hell-fire. Their strategy consisted of forcing as well as enticing them into the fold of Christianity, among other things, by their doctrine of vicarious atonement of S.\u2018Isa A.S. In case of the Muslim countries there was an added reason for enmity in their attempt to wreak vengeance of their repeated defeats at the hands of Muslims in the Wars of Crusades over a long period of time. | tarabilus (Tripoli) is a port in Tripolitania, which is the northwestern province of the present day Libya, extending from the Mediterranean to the Sahara. It was invaded and conquered by Italy in 1911-12, when it was a part of the Khilafah. | The machinations of the European imperialists against the Islamic Ummah have been documented in many books which can be consulted for details. | The bereavement of Muslims was caused not only by the conquest of Muslim countries by Europeans but by the atrocities during and after such conquests. All colonial countries have witnessed them. The following few quotations show the seriousness of the matter: | (Shakab Arsalan (1869-1946) was a Druze Muslim, who fought constantly against European powers throughout his life. - Author.) | \u201cHis (Arsalan\u2019s) commitment was most evident in his reaction to the Italian invasion of Libya in October 1911, when he went to the battle-front himself. This response although more direct than others was not unrepresentative of reverberations which the Italian invasion produced throughout the Arab Islam. In Tunisia there were open anti-Italian riots; in Egypt a strong wave of pro-Uthmaniyah sentiment swept across all levels of society. Fear of the systematic European campaign against Islam was heightened by the fact that French forces had occupied Fez in the spring of 1911, initiating the final stages in the process that added Morocco to the international system of protectorates.\u201d (p. 19) | The so-called \u201cInternational system of protectorates\u201d was the establishment of suzerainty of European powers. (Author) | \u201cIn this earlier phase, which is our concern here, Arsalan was never more outspoken than in his condemnation of General Graziani\u2019s brutalization of the Cryenaican population. He wrote to Rida that when he learnt of the deportations, executions, tortures and sexual humiliations inflicted on the civilian population of Jabal al- Akhzar \u201cI let my pen loose on those dogs\u201d. In article after article, he enumerated the horrors committed by the Italian forces and condemned Fascist Italy as being beyond the pale of humankind......... He told his readers that when the Italian forces captured the oasis of Kufrah, they turned the Great Sanusi Zawiyyah into a tavern where they drank toasts to the extermination of Muslims of Tripoli ; and they threw the Holy Qur\u2019an\u2019s beneath their horses\u2019 hooves and then used them to light the fires of their cooking pots.\u201d (p. 100). | \u201cThe Italian abuse of Islam and the population of Libya meant more than the atrocities themselves. The real objective of the Fascist government was the extermination of Islam from the entire region and replacing it with Christian colonists. Arsalan saw the Fascists in Libya acting as Ferdinand and Isabella had done toward the Moor of Spain. (pp. 100-101) | In reality one does not have to read any books to appreciate the serious nature of the situation with reference to the relationships of the Western world and their henchmen with the Islamic world. One has only to look around in the present day world to witness the heart rending atrocities of the Western nations and their proxies against the Islamic world. First sight observation is worth a million books.\n\nWhen I felt this ignoble strife of the world grievous | Packing up my goods and chattel I departed from the world\nThough I did pass life within limits of morning and evening | I never got acquainted with the old system of the world\nThe angles took me to the assembly of the Holy Prophet | They took me to the audience of the symbol of God\u2019s Mercy\nThe Holy Prophet said \u201c O nightingale of the garden of Hijaz! | Each flower-bud of yours is melted with your music\u2019s warmth\nYour heart is always ecstatic with the wine-cup of God\u2019s proximity | Your supplication is the envy of prostrations in Divine Love\nIn your flight from the lowly world to the celestial world | The angels taught you the elegance of the flight\nYou have come like fragrance out of the world\u2019s garden | With what gift for me have come you?\u201d\n\u201cSire ! Satisfaction on the earth is not available | The life I am searching for is not available\nThousands of tulips and roses exist in the garden of existence | The flower-bud with the fragrance of fidelity is not available\nBut I have brought a lover\u2019s wine-glass as an offering | Whatever is in this even in paradise is not available\nGlistens your Ummah\u2019s honor in this | Blood of Tripoli\u2019s martyrs is in this\u201d","poem_id":"","theme":"offering"}

A few of these poems have been mentioned in the Introduction to Poem 88 \u201cShakwah\u201d (The Complaint). | The causes of the fall of the Muslim Ummah can be grouped into two classes, viz. the machinations of the Western world and the shortcomings of the Muslim themselves.The present poem is complementary to Shakwah. In Shakwah the \u2018Allamah complains to God for the deplorable condition of the Muslim world and society and prays for help. In the present poem he relays the response given by God to Muslims. The details of the response are generally restricted to the Muslims\u2019 own faults. These faults can be summarized as follows: | 1. Muslims have distanced themselves from the Holy Qur\u2019an, Islamic values and the norms of their ancestors, and have adopted Western norms in thought and deeds. | 2. They have given up Islamic learning. | 3. Insincere religious and political leadership has appeared. | 4. Muslims have lost the Love of God and the zeal for Tawhad. | 5.They have fallen into traditionalism | 6. They have given up activism and struggle in the cause of God and have adopted asceticism and monasticism. | 7. They have lost the urge for struggle in the cause of Islam. | 8.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about are","output":"This long poem is part of the series of long poems in which \u2018Allamah Iqbal has discussed the rise and fall of the Muslim Ummah and has analyzed its causes, shown his bereavement as well as has offered its cure and has given the message of hope. A few of these poems have been mentioned in the Introduction to Poem 88 \u201cShakwah\u201d (The Complaint). | The causes of the fall of the Muslim Ummah can be grouped into two classes, viz. the machinations of the Western world and the shortcomings of the Muslim themselves.The present poem is complementary to Shakwah. In Shakwah the \u2018Allamah complains to God for the deplorable condition of the Muslim world and society and prays for help. In the present poem he relays the response given by God to Muslims. The details of the response are generally restricted to the Muslims\u2019 own faults. These faults can be summarized as follows: | 1. Muslims have distanced themselves from the Holy Qur\u2019an, Islamic values and the norms of their ancestors, and have adopted Western norms in thought and deeds. | 2. They have given up Islamic learning. | 3. Insincere religious and political leadership has appeared. | 4. Muslims have lost the Love of God and the zeal for Tawhad. | 5.They have fallen into traditionalism | 6. They have given up activism and struggle in the cause of God and have adopted asceticism and monasticism. | 7. They have lost the urge for struggle in the cause of Islam. | 8. Muslim society is riddled with dissensions | 9.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about Mighfar","output":"The Ruhalahs were an Afghan tribe who had inhabited an area about 10,000 square miles north east of Delhi. They had acquired much influence and political power by the fourth decade of the eighteenth century. At that time they were a formidable force and proved very effective in breaking the back bone of the Marhatas in the third battle of Panipat, near Delhi in 1761. This battle was fought mainly by the Afghan leader, Ahmad Shah Abdala, helped by Najab al-Daulah, the Prime Minister of the Mughal Emperor with some help from the Ruhalahs. This watershed event occurred under the able and timely political move of the great \u2018alim and sufi of Delhi, Shah Wala Allah. Notwithstanding these services to Islam Ruhalahs helped themselves as well to the spoils of the chaos resulting from the decline and break up of the Mughal Empire. This poem relates an anecdote of the attack of Ghulam Qadir Ruhalah on the Red Fort, Delhi in which he blinded the Mughal Emperor and entered into the conversation described in the poem. The last line of the poem is also its lesson, which is that in luxury and indolence a nation loses the will to strive for a virile and self-respecting life. As \u2018Allamah Iqbal says: | (202) What was unacceptable gradually became accepted | In slavery nation\u2019s conscience becomes spoiled\n\nHow cruel, tyrant and vindictive the Ruhalah was | He blinded the Mughal Emperor with the point of his dagger\nThe tyrant ordered members of the royal household to dance | This tyranny was no less than the Judgment Day\u2019s signal\nFor the delicate ladies of the royal household it was | Utterly impossible to comply with this shameless order\nAh ! The merciless one made them the means of pleasure | Whose beauty had been veiled from sun\u2019s, moon\u2019s and stars\nThe feeble hearts were throbbing, the feet were forced to move | A river of blood was flowing from the wet eyes of the princesses\nFor some time his eyes remained thus absorbed in seeing | In confusion he freed his head from the load of Mighfar\nHe untied the deadly, fire-spitting sword from the waist | Whose sharpness was a source of luminescence to the stars\nHe put the dagger in front, and lied down in some thought | Sleep was demanding rest from the red eyes so to say\nThe water of sleep extinguished the embers of his eyes | The tyrant\u2019s sight became ashamed of the painful spectacle!\nHe got up and started saying this to Taimur\u2019s household | \u201cYou should have no complaint against your fate\u201d\nMy sleeping in the couch was a mere show, an affectation | Because stupor is foreign to the dignity of fighters\nIt was my intention that some daughter of Taimur | Considering me unconscious might kill me with my own dagger,\nBut at last this secret has dawned to the whole world | Concern for honor has departed from Taimur\u2019s household","poem_id":"","theme":"Mighfar"}

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about qudsis","output":"This poem was written in Europe at the time of the death of \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s mother. It is not only an expression of his grief on this sad incident but is also an expression of the philosophy of life and death and the grief created by them. It expands the thoughts expressed in Poem No. 82 Falsafah-i-Gham (The Philosophy of Grief). In spite of realizing that everything in the universe is subject to the Will and Command of God the news of his mother\u2019s death was too hard to bear. He reminisces his whole life and recapitulates some memorable events of his domestic life. He explains with several examples , that death is a transitory phase in existence and is not designed to annihilate a person. The last verse of stanza 8 is important. By comparing man with stars he presents the Islamic concept of man\u2019s superiority over the rest of creation. The last two verses of stanza 10 are important. Though time mitigates all grief the loss of his mother has caused him so much grief that time cannot reduce it. The poem ends in a supplication to God for his mother.\n\nEvery particle of the universe is a prisoner of destiny | Prudence is a cover for helplessness and compulsion\nThe sky, the sun and the moon all are helpless | The fast moving stars are compelled to moving\nBreaking is the end of flower bud\u2019s pitcher in the garden | The garden\u2019s verdure and flowers are also compelled to grow\nIt may be nightingale\u2019s song or conscience\u2019 silent call | Everything is chained in the same universal chain!\nWhen this secret of helplessness becomes evident to the eye | The turbulent flood of tears in the heart dries up\nThe dance of pleasure and grief does not remain in the human heart | The song remains but the pleasure of treble and bass does not remain\nKnowledge and wisdom are robbers of tears and sighs\u2019 wealth | That is the intelligent heart is a piece of diamond!\nThough the dew\u2019s freshness does not exist in my garden | My eye is not enriched with the red tears\nAh! I am aware of the secret of human afflictions | But my nature\u2019s orchestra is unaware of complaint\u2019s song\nThe story of vicissitudes of time does not come on my lips | My heart is not astonished, not laughing, not crying\nBut O messenger, your picture is one of constant wailing | Ah! this is the contradiction of my firm wisdom!\nLife\u2019s foundation becomes lasting with overflowing wailing | The hard hearted Intellect is embarrassed with the knowledge of pathos\nMy mirror is bright with the wave of sighs\u2019 smoke | My skirt is full with the treasure of tears\nThe miracle of your picture has surprised me | Which has completely changed the flight of time\nAs if it brought the past and present together | It acquainted me again with the age of infancy\nWhen that feeble soul was being nurtured by your side | Whose tongue was not adequately familiar with talking\nAnd whose linguistic spice is now the subject of conversation | The pearls of whose jewel-shedding eyes are priceless\nThe learning\u2019s serious discourses, the shrewdness of old age | The dignity of worldly honors, the pride of young age\nWe descend from the positions of dignity in life | We descend as a simple child in the lap of the mother\nWe are laughing informally, we are free from care | We are once more living in the same lost paradise\nAh! Who will now be waiting for me in the homeland? | Who will become restless by not getting my letter?\nI will come to your grave carrying this lament | To whose thoughts will I come in the midnight prayers?\nWith your up-bringing I became fortunate like stars | The house of my ancestors became a source of pride\nYour life was written in gold letters in the existence\u2019 book | Your life was a full lesson of secular and religious education\nYour love remained in my service for your whole life | When I was able to serve you, you did not survive\nThat youth who equals the slender cypress in stature | Who became more fortunate in serving you than me\nThat constant companion of mine in the business of life | That picture of yours in love, that source of my strength\nHe is crying like a helpless infant for you | He is crying with impatience from morning till evening\nThe love whose seed you planted in our life\u2019s field | By the grief of separation that love became more firm\nAh! This world, this mourning place for the young and old! | In what a strange ever-changing prison man is imprisoned!\nHow difficult it is to live! How easy it is to die! | In the existence\u2019 garden death is cheap as breeze!\nThere are earthquakes, thunderbolts, famines, afflictions | How diverse the daughters of the mother of time are!\nIn poor man\u2019s hovel, in rich man\u2019s mansion is death | In forest, house, city, garden, wilderness is death\nDeath is tumultuous in the silent ocean | Boats are drowned in the lap of death\nNeither there is ability to complain, nor power of speech | Life nothing but is a yoke choking the throat\nIn the caravan nothing but bell\u2019s wailing exists | Nothing except the valuable weeping eye exists!\nHowever, this period of trial will also come to its end | Behind the sky\u2019s nine orbits there are other orbits also\nWhat if the tulips and roses in this garden are afflicted? | What if nightingales are compelled to wail and complain?\nThe bushes, which are burnt by the sighs of the autumn | Will green up when the breezes of the invigorating spring flow\nWhat if our spark is asleep in the dust of the shield? | What if this handful of dust is our temporary abode?\nThe end of the fire of life is not in the ashes! | This is not the jewel whose destiny is breaking!\nLife is such a beloved in the eye of Nature | Life\u2019s preservation is in everything\u2019s nature\nIf the death\u2019s hand could efface life\u2019s picture | The system of the universe would not have made it so common\nIf it is cheap then think that death is nothing | Just as there is no break in living by sleeping\nAh !

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about stature","output":"This poem was written in Europe at the time of the death of \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s mother. It is not only an expression of his grief on this sad incident but is also an expression of the philosophy of life and death and the grief created by them.

He explains with several examples , that death is a transitory phase in existence and is not designed to annihilate a person. The last verse of stanza 8 is important. By comparing man with stars he presents the Islamic concept of man\u2019s superiority over the rest of creation. The last two verses of stanza 10 are important.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about pearl","output":"Out of the many differences between Islam and Hinduism the two most important ones in the view of \u2018Allamah Iqbal are (I) Tawhad-i-Ilah (Unity of God) and (ii) Tawhad-i-Insaniyat (Unity of mankind).

Hinduism is an amalgam of traditions and rituals, of devotional and philosophical systems, built over the past 4500 years, arising from the indigenous Dravidian cults and successive invasions from outside, especially those of Aryans (2000-1500 B.C.). The oldest existing religious book of Hindus is the Vedas (Ca. 500 B.C.). In the context of this poem the Hindu society is traditionally divided into four classes or castes. viz. (i) Brahman (priests) (ii) Khashtrya (noble warriors) (iii) Vaishya (merchants and farmers) and (iv) Shudra (workers). The last mentioned are also untouchables.

The second reform came in the 16th century in the form of Sikhism founded by Guru Nanak. This religion was a movement for reformation of Hinduism under the strong influence of Islam.

This is more so for the Muslim Ummah whom the Holy Qur\u2019an has declared as the \u2018best nation\u2019 (3:110). Also, we learn from the Holy Qur\u2019an that man can have only what he strives for (53:39-42). | This poem was written when the Muslims all over the world generally, and in the Indian sub-continent particularly, were working for the restoration of the Khilafah in Turkey. However, a great part of their effort consisted of approaching the British Government in London and the League of Nations in Geneva for doing justice to Muslims. \u2018Allamah Iqbal tells them in this poem that such efforts would be of no avail. This proved to be true. Another poem, given below, is also on the allied subject of Palestine and the occupation of the same by the Jews: | Falas\u00e8ana \u2018Arab Se (Addressed to the Palestinian Arab) | (216) From whose heat the world is not yet relieved | I know that fire is in your existence | (217) Your remedy is neither in Geneva nor in London | As the Europe\u2019s jugular vein is in Jews\u2019 clutches | (218) I have heard that the relief of nations from slavery | Is in nurture of self-cognizance and assertion\u2019s taste\n\nIf the territory is being lost let it be lost | You should not be disloyal to God\u2019s commands\nDo you not have knowledge of history? | You have started begging for the Khilafah!\nIf we do not purchase with our own blood | Such sovereignty is a disgrace to the Muslim!\n\u201cI do not feel as much ashamed of being broken down | As in asking others for m\u00e0miya\u2019a for my treatment\u201d","poem_id":"","theme":"treatment\u201d"}
{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about Alamut","output":"This long poem is an allegory prepared to convey \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s philosophy on several social, economic and political problems facing the world in general and the Muslim world in particular. It is based on an imaginary conversation with S. Khizar A.S. on the model of that described in the Holy Qur\u2019an 18:60-82. The artistic perfection of the poet has made the parallel perfect. S. Musa A.S. was guided through wahy to search for S. Khizar A.S. for obtaining eternal secrets. The Holy Qur\u2019an uses the expression Majma\u2018 al- Bahrain for the meeting of the two, which may mean confluence of two seas or two rivers. The consensus of opinion among exegesists is that this place was the Gulf of Aqabah. However, \u2018Allamah Abu al-A\u2018la Mawduda has expressed the opinion that the meeting place could have been at the junction of the two tributaries of the River Nile, the \u201cBahr-al-Abyaz\u201d (The White Nile) and \u201cBahr-al-Arzaq\u201d (The Blue Nile) in Sudan. Bahr also means a large river which agrees with the word Darya used in this poem. However, irrespective of the meeting place the poem describes the questions posed by \u2018Allamah Iqbal in the first part and the answers he received in subsequent parts.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about again","output":"This long poem is an allegory prepared to convey \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s philosophy on several social, economic and political problems facing the world in general and the Muslim world in particular. It is based on an imaginary conversation with S. Khizar A.S. on the model of that described in the Holy Qur\u2019an 18:60-82. The artistic perfection of the poet has made the parallel perfect. S. Musa A.S. was guided through wahy to search for S. Khizar A.S. for obtaining eternal secrets. The Holy Qur\u2019an uses the expression Majma\u2018 al- Bahrain for the meeting of the two, which may mean confluence of two seas or two rivers. The consensus of opinion among exegesists is that this place was the Gulf of Aqabah. However, \u2018Allamah Abu al-A\u2018la Mawduda has expressed the opinion that the meeting place could have been at the junction of the two tributaries of the River Nile, the \u201cBahr-al-Abyaz\u201d (The White Nile) and \u201cBahr-al-Arzaq\u201d (The Blue Nile) in Sudan. Bahr also means a large river which agrees with the word Darya used in this poem. However, irrespective of the meeting place the poem describes the questions posed by \u2018Allamah Iqbal in the first part and the answers he received in subsequent parts.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about wall\u201d","output":"This long poem is an allegory prepared to convey \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s philosophy on several social, economic and political problems facing the world in general and the Muslim world in particular. It is based on an imaginary conversation with S. Khizar A.S. on the model of that described in the Holy Qur\u2019an 18:60-82. The artistic perfection of the poet has made the parallel perfect. S. Musa A.S. was guided through wahy to search for S. Khizar A.S. for obtaining eternal secrets. The Holy Qur\u2019an uses the expression Majma\u2018 al- Bahrain for the meeting of the two, which may mean confluence of two seas or two rivers. The consensus of opinion among exegesists is that this place was the Gulf of Aqabah.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about strength","output":"This long poem is an allegory prepared to convey \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s philosophy on several social, economic and political problems facing the world in general and the Muslim world in particular.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about Arab","output":"This long poem is an allegory prepared to convey \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s philosophy on several social, economic and political problems facing the world in general and the Muslim world in particular. It is based on an imaginary conversation with S. Khizar A.S. on the model of that described in the Holy Qur\u2019an 18:60-82. The artistic perfection of the poet has made the parallel perfect. S. Musa A.S. was guided through wahy to search for S. Khizar A.S. for obtaining eternal secrets. The Holy Qur\u2019an uses the expression Majma\u2018 al- Bahrain for the meeting of the two, which may mean confluence of two seas or two rivers. The consensus of opinion among exegesists is that this place was the Gulf of Aqabah. However, \u2018Allamah Abu al-A\u2018la Mawduda has expressed the opinion that the meeting place could have been at the junction of the two tributaries of the River Nile, the \u201cBahr-al-Abyaz\u201d (The White Nile) and \u201cBahr-al-Arzaq\u201d (The Blue Nile) in Sudan. Bahr also means a large river which agrees with the word Darya used in this poem. However, irrespective of the meeting place the poem describes the questions posed by \u2018Allamah Iqbal in the first part and the answers he received in subsequent parts.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about blood","output":"This long poem is an allegory prepared to convey \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s philosophy on several social, economic and political problems facing the world in general and the Muslim world in particular. It is based on an imaginary conversation with S. Khizar A.S. on the model of that described in the Holy Qur\u2019an 18:60-82. The artistic perfection of the poet has made the parallel perfect. S. Musa A.S. was guided through wahy to search for S. Khizar A.S. for obtaining eternal secrets. The Holy Qur\u2019an uses the expression Majma\u2018 al- Bahrain for the meeting of the two, which may mean confluence of two seas or two rivers. The consensus of opinion among exegesists is that this place was the Gulf of Aqabah. However, \u2018Allamah Abu al-A\u2018la Mawduda has expressed the opinion that the meeting place could have been at the junction of the two tributaries of the River Nile, the \u201cBahr-al-Abyaz\u201d (The White Nile) and \u201cBahr-al-Arzaq\u201d (The Blue Nile) in Sudan. Bahr also means a large river which agrees with the word Darya used in this poem. However, irrespective of the meeting place the poem describes the questions posed by \u2018Allamah Iqbal in the first part and the answers he received in subsequent parts.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about Adam","output":"This long poem is an allegory prepared to convey \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s philosophy on several social, economic and political problems facing the world in general and the Muslim world in particular. It is based on an imaginary conversation with S. Khizar A.S. on the model of that described in the Holy Qur\u2019an 18:60-82. The artistic perfection of the poet has made the parallel perfect. S. Musa A.S. was guided through wahy to search for S. Khizar A.S. for obtaining eternal secrets. The Holy Qur\u2019an uses the expression Majma\u2018 al- Bahrain for the meeting of the two, which may mean confluence of two seas or two rivers. The consensus of opinion among exegesists is that this place was the Gulf of Aqabah. However, \u2018Allamah Abu al-A\u2018la Mawduda has expressed the opinion that the meeting place could have been at the junction of the two tributaries of the River Nile, the \u201cBahr-al-Abyaz\u201d (The White Nile) and \u201cBahr-al-Arzaq\u201d (The Blue Nile) in Sudan. Bahr also means a large river which agrees with the word Darya used in this poem. However, irrespective of the meeting place the poem describes the questions posed by \u2018Allamah Iqbal in the first part and the answers he received in subsequent parts.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about Ibraham\u2019s","output":"This long poem is an allegory prepared to convey \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s philosophy on several social, economic and political problems facing the world in general and the Muslim world in particular. It is based on an imaginary conversation with S. Khizar A.S. on the model of that described in the Holy Qur\u2019an 18:60-82. The artistic perfection of the poet has made the parallel perfect. S. Musa A.S. was guided through wahy to search for S. Khizar A.S. for obtaining eternal secrets.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about foundation!","output":"This long poem is an allegory prepared to convey \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s philosophy on several social, economic and political problems facing the world in general and the Muslim world in particular. It is based on an imaginary conversation with S. Khizar A.S. on the model of that described in the Holy Qur\u2019an 18:60-82. The artistic perfection of the poet has made the parallel perfect. S. Musa A.S. was guided through wahy to search for S. Khizar A.S. for obtaining eternal secrets.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about Namrud","output":"This long poem is an allegory prepared to convey \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s philosophy on several social, economic and political problems facing the world in general and the Muslim world in particular. It is based on an imaginary conversation with S. Khizar A.S. on the model of that described in the Holy Qur\u2019an 18:60-82. The artistic perfection of the poet has made the parallel perfect. S. Musa A.S. was guided through wahy to search for S. Khizar A.S. for obtaining eternal secrets. The Holy Qur\u2019an uses the expression Majma\u2018 al- Bahrain for the meeting of the two, which may mean confluence of two seas or two rivers. The consensus of opinion among exegesists is that this place was the Gulf of Aqabah.

Bahr also means a large river which agrees with the word Darya used in this poem.

{"input":"Write a poem in Iqbal's style about Alexander","output":"This long poem is an allegory prepared to convey \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s philosophy on several social, economic and political problems facing the world in general and the Muslim world in particular. It is based on an imaginary conversation with S. Khizar A.S. on the model of that described in the Holy Qur\u2019an 18:60-82. The artistic perfection of the poet has made the parallel perfect. S. Musa A.S. was guided through wahy to search for S. Khizar A.S. for obtaining eternal secrets. The Holy Qur\u2019an uses the expression Majma\u2018 al- Bahrain for the meeting of the two, which may mean confluence of two seas or two rivers. The consensus of opinion among exegesists is that this place was the Gulf of Aqabah. However, \u2018Allamah Abu al-A\u2018la Mawduda has expressed the opinion that the meeting place could have been at the junction of the two tributaries of the River Nile, the \u201cBahr-al-Abyaz\u201d (The White Nile) and \u201cBahr-al-Arzaq\u201d (The Blue Nile) in Sudan. Bahr also means a large river which agrees with the word Darya used in this poem. However, irrespective of the meeting place the poem describes the questions posed by \u2018Allamah Iqbal in the first part and the answers he received in subsequent parts.

sky changes its colors in a moment\nCursor certainly would be concerned with remedial measures | In the belly of obedience has started unequaled convulsion\nSir Agha Khan is demanding the delegation from India | Is this the digestive for devouring Iraq and Palestine\nOne day a dispute arose between the farmer and the owner | Each of them was saying that the land belonged to him\nThe farmer said that the field belonged to the cultivator | The owner said that the farmer had become demented\nI asked the land as to whose property it was | It replied that it was believing only this:\nWhether it be the owner or the wretched farmer | Whatever is under the sky is property of the land\nThrow them out in the alley | The new civilization\u2019s eggs are rotten\nElection, membership, council, presidency | The nooses of independence are very strange\nThe carpenter has also been pared | The Europe\u2019s planes are very sharp\nThe owner of the factory is a useless man | He is very pleasure

Hijaza are, but in heart Hijaza could no be\nThough eyes become wet there is no pleasure is in this weeping | If by mixture of affliction\u2019s blood tears pink could not be\nIqbal is a good advisor,
