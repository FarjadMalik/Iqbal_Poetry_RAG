      "full_text": "This poem belongs to the first period of \u2018Allamah Iqbal's poetic and intellectual evolution, which ended at the time of his departure to Europe in 1905 for higher studies. This period is considered to be the period of \u2018Allamah Iqbal's nature poetry. \"Himalah\" is the opening poem of Bang-i-Dara. It eulogizes the physical beauty and geographical importance of the Himalayan Range. Though mountains are equated with natural beauty all over the world, and the beauty of many mountain regions has been extolled by poets and other intellectuals alike, the Himalayas stand out as a shining star in the galaxy of the world's mountain ranges. | The Himalayas form an extensive mountain range which stretches across the northern side of the Indian sub-continent from Kashmar to Assam, between the valleys of the Indus and Brahamaputra Rivers. It is bout 2,400 km. long and 160-240 km. wide and joins the Karakorums and the Hindu Kush Ranges. It is the highest mountain range in the world and includes some of the world's highest peaks, viz. Everest (8,847 m.), Kanchenjunga (8,579 m.), Nanga Parbat (8,126 m.) Annapurna (8,078 m.), and Nanda Devi (7, 817 m.). | The word \"Himalaya\" is derived from the Sanskrit word \"Himachal\", meaning the \"Abode of Snow\". The name reflects the long range of permanently snow covered peaks, which are among the highest in the world and form a continuous wall of shimmering silver. Words cannot describe the beauty of this mountain range. It must be seen to be appreciated. \"A hundred divine epochs would not suffice to describe the marvels of the Himalayas\", says a Sanskrit proverb. | \u2018Allamah Iqbal, a native of the Indo-Pakistan sub-continent was of Kashmar origin. Kashmar , which is a part of the Himalayan Range, and in itself is beauty par excellence, must have inspired him with a special love. However, his object in writing this poem was not merely to sing the praises of this mountain tract. Being an \u2018arif, the beauty of God's countenance as reflected in His creation had become manifest to his insight. He was moved by the beauty and the grandeur of the Himalayas. To him the Himalayas were one of the innumerable master pieces of the Creative Power and Artistry of God. To him it was one of the shuhuds of God's artistry, and a way of witnessing His Tajalla-i-Sura. This feeling bursts out in verse 3. I myself had the good fortune of living and working in the sylvan beauty of the Himalayas for about twenty years of my life and of sharing the feelings of Sa\u2018da, when he says: | (158) The leaves of green trees in the wise man's perception | Every leaf is an encyclopedia of the Creator's cognition | Modern knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the plant leaf attests to these attributes.\n\nO Himalah! O rampart of the realm of India! | Bowing down, the sky kisses your forehead\nYour condition does not show any signs of old age | You are young in the midst of day and night's alternation\nThe Kalam of tur Sana witnessed but one Effulgence | For the discerning eye you are an embodiment of Effulgence\nTo the outward eye you are a mere mountain range | In reality you are our sentinel, you are India's rampart\nYou are the diwan whose opening verse is the sky | You lead Man to the solitudes of his heart's retreat\nSnow has endowed you with the turban of honour | Which scoffs at the crown of the world-illuminating sun\nAntiquity is but a moment of your bygone age | Dark clouds are encamped in your valleys\nYour peaks are matching with the pleiades in elegance | Though you are standing on earth your abode is sky's expanse\nThe stream in your flank is a fast flowing mirror | For which the breeze is working like a kerchief\nThe mountain top's lightning has given a whip | In the hands of cloud for the ambling horse\nO Himalah! Are you like a theater stage | Which nature's hand has made for its elements?\nAh! How the cloud is swaying in excessive joy | The cloud like an unchained elephant is speeding\nGentle movement of the morning zephyr is acting like a cradle | Every flower bud is swinging with intoxication of existence\nThe flower bud's silence with the petal's tongue is saying | \"I have never experienced the jerk of the florist's hand\nSilence itself is relating the tale of mine | The corner of nature's solitude is the abode of mine\"\nThe brook is melodiously descending from the high land | Putting the waves of Kawthar and Tasnam to embarrassment\nAs if showing the mirror to Nature's beauty | Now evading now rowing against the rock in its way\nPlay in passing this orchestra of beautiful music | O wayfarer! The heart comprehends your music\nWhen the night's Lailah unfurls her long hair | The sound of water-falls allures the heart\nThat silence of the night whose beauty surpasses speech | That state of silent meditation overshadowing the trees\nThat dusk's beauty which shivers along the mountain range | Very beautiful looks this rouge on your cheeks\nO Himalah!

Man should appreciate, enjoy and respect the beauty of the cosmos and should not create chaos therein by interfering with, abusing or damaging the same for satisfaction of his material needs. This longing, or the continuous search for the Truth created in the poet's heart, which in fact should exist in every Muslim's heart would eventually illuminate the world and would train the human intellect and guide it into spiritual channels instead of leaving it as an unbridled steed as at present.\n\nYou are not familiar with the hardships of solving enigmas | O Beautiful Rose!

        "Longing: \"Longing\" or ardent desire is one of the important planks of `Allamah Iqbal\u2019s philosophy. However, this longing is not for the material things of life or the satisfaction of physical desires, which is found in all living things. What distinguishes Man from other creation and entitles him to the honor of being God\u2019s vicegerent on earth is the \"longing\" for more elegant goals and more sublime desires than mere indulgence in material pleasures. His longing is a limitless ocean of search for knowing the Truth and the Purpose of the creation of God, knowledge of His Essence, and fixing of high ideals for life, such as struggle in the cause of God. These thoughts exist throughout his works and many poems in this book also contain them. This \"longing\" is a part of the efforts for the cognition and development of the self, This is beautifully explained in his book Asrar-i-Khuda.",

This must be admired, and (ii) falling to flattery is an evil which leads to destruction and must be avoided.\n\nOne day a spider said to a fly | \"Though you pass this way daily\nMy hut has never been honored by you | By making a chance visit inside by you\nThough depriving strangers of a visit does not matter | Evading the near and dear ones does not look good\nMy house will be honored by a visit by you | A ladder is before you if you decide to step in\nHearing this the fly said to the spider, | \"Sire, you should entice some simpleton thus\nThis fly would never be pulled into your net | Whoever climbed your net could never step down\"\nThe spider said, \"How strange, you consider me a cheat | I have never seen a simpleton like you in the world\nI only wanted to entertain you | I had no personal gain in view\nYou have come flying from some unknown distant place | Resting for a while in my house would not harm you\nMany things in this house are worth your seeing | Though apparently a humble hut you are seeing\nDainty drapes are hanging from the doors | And I have decorated the walls with mirrors\nBeddings are available for guests\u2019 comforts | Not to everyone\u2019s lot do fall these comforts\".\nThe fly said, \"All this may very well be | But do not expect me to enter your house\n\"May God protect me from these soft beds | Once asleep in them getting up again is impossible\"\nThe spider spoke to itself on hearing this talk | \"How to trap it? This wretched fellow is clever\nMany desires are fulfilled with flattery in the world | All in the world are enslaved with flattery\"\nThinking this the spider spoke to the fly thus! | \"Madam, God has bestowed great honors on you!\nEveryone loves your beautiful face | Even if someone sees you for the first time\nYour eyes look like clusters of glittering diamonds | God has adorned your beautiful head with a plume\nThis beauty, this dress, this elegance, this neatness! | And all this is very much enhanced by singing in flight\".\nThe fly was touched by this flattery | And spoke, \"I do not fear you any more\nI hate the habit of declining requests | Disappointing somebody is bad indeed\"\nSaying this it flew from its place | When it got close the spider snapped it\nThe spider had been starving for many days | The fly provided a good leisurely meal",

Similarly, hell will be a transient abode to a Mu'min, to consume his sins and purify his soul, after which he will be admitted into Paradise. It is appropriate to give here \u2018Allamah Iqbal's views on this matter and his rationale:",
        "also: according to the teachings of the Qur\u2019an the ego's re-emergence brings him a sharp sight [50:22, (read with 17:13)] whereby he clearly sees his self-built fate fastened round his neck. Heaven and Hell are states, not localities. The descriptions in the Qur\u2019an are visual representations of an inner fact, i.e. character. Hell, in the words of the Qur\u2019an is God's kindled fire which mounts above the hearts - the painful realization of one's failure as a man. Heaven is the joy of triumph over the forces of disintegration. There is no such thing as eternal damnation in Islam. The word 'eternity' used in certain verses, relating to Hell, is explained by the Qur'an itself to mean only a period of time (78:23). Time cannot be wholly irrelevant to the development of personality. Character tends to become permanent; its re-shaping must require time. Hell, therefore, as conceived by the Qur'an is not a pit of everlasting torture inflicted by a revengeful God; it is a corrective experience which may make a hardened ego once more sensitive to the living breeze of Divine Grace. Nor is Heaven a holiday. Life is one and continuous. Man marches always onward to receive ever fresh illuminations from the Infinite Reality which 'every moment appears in a new glory. And the recipient of Divine Illuminations is not merely a passive recipient. Every act of a free ego creates a new situation, and thus further opportunities of creative unfolding.\"",
        "?: This alludes to the Holy Qur\u2019an 7:142-43. It means that Man is unable to see God in this material world and prophets are no exception to this.",
        "dome: The material human desire to understand everything terrestrial as well as celestial has led him into fields of materialistic knowledge which have partially or fully blinded him to the Beauty of Light and Truth, or the Jamal of God. However, every person derives the blessing or the curse of knowledge according to the measure of his effort and sincerity. Some people go completely astray and some witness the full Light of Truth and the majority get a combination of both to varying degrees. Imam Ghazala R.A. has discussed the different kinds of knowledge in detail in his famous book Al-Ihya al-'Ulum. 73-359. Mawlana Ruma has put all this wisdom in a nutshell in the following verse:"

      "full_text": "This poem, though simple in language, is charged with mystic thought. As this is the first poem of its kind in this book and many more will follow it appears appropriate to clarify a few points. The commonplace phenomena of \"Gul-O-Bulbul \" (the association of the flower and the nightingale), and \"Sham`-o-Parwanah\" (the candle and the moth) have always been symbolic of the lover-beloved relationship in Persian and Urdu poetry. However, much of this poetry has long been conventional and poems have been evaluated on the basis of their linguistic beauty, innovative expressions and elegance of style without paying much attention to the subject matter or the depth of thought expressed in the poem. | Poetry is a spontaneous expression of human emotions. The most important human emotion is love, both of the material form and that of the innate qualities of the beloved. Pre-Islamic poetry was usually amorous. Wine with its accompaniments of the cup, the goblet, the decanter, the cup bearer and the tavern were commonly used. Though this practice prevailed in all literatures it was most predominant in the pre-Islamic Arabic poetry. Exaggeration was a very common and much liked attribute of poets and poetry. For that reason the Holy Qur'an frowned at poets (26:224-26). However, it should be remembered that the above verse does not amount to outright condemnation of all poets and all poetry, but is only a passing remark on the aspect of misleading others by exaggeration. Reference to the Holy Qur\u2019an 26:221-24 would clarify this statement. | The world is heavily indebted to Islam and Muslims for metamorphosing romantic poetry and sublimating it from amorous love to that of Divine Love. God, the Holy Prophet S.A.W. and his descendants became the \"beloved\" instead of human forms. Thus, mundane, albeit natural, human emotion was sublimated into pure and angelic form. Acts of worship became changed from mere rituals to submission to the Will of God and fear motivated exercises became sublimated to those of the Love of the highest order (The Holy Qur\u2019an 41:37). New forms of poetry, like \"hamd\", \"na\u2018t\" , \"thana\" marthiah and new kinds of music, like \"qawwala \", came into existence for the expression of Man's Love for God, the Holy Prophet S.A.W. and his descendants, as well as for other heroes and heroines of Islam. | All the terminology, conventionally used in amorous poetry, like wine, cup, goblet, decanter, cup bearer and tavern acquired new meanings. In fact mysticism itself changed from a vague, esoteric, occult concept into one of concrete, systematic effort for the comprehension of the Ultimate Truth about the Existence as well as the Essence of God, based on the feelings of the heart of a true Lover of Him, rather than through dry and insipid reasoning of the philosopher. A whole technique was developed for seeking the Divine Light and for expressing human Love for the Divine Being. This technique has borne the test of the criterion of repeatability required by the scientific method. The new science acquired the name of \"Tasawwuf\" or \"Sufism\". | In this poem the poet has sublimated the proverbial love of the moth for the candle into the Love of a Mu\u2019min for God. The poem will become full of meaning if read in this light.\n\nO Candle! Why does the moth love you? | Why is this restless soul devoted to you?\nYour charm keeps it restless like mercury | Did you teach it the etiquette of Love?\nIt circumambulates the site of your manifestation | Is it inspired with the fire of your lightning?\nDo the woes of death give it the peace of life? | Does your flame possess the quality of eternal life?\nIf you do not brighten this sorrowful world | This burning heart's tree of Longing may not green up\nFalling before you is the prayer of this little heart | The taste for impassioned Love knows this little heart\nIt has some zeal of the Primeval Beauty's Lover | You are a small tur it is a small Kalam\nThe moth and the taste for the Sight of the Light! | This small insect and the Longing for the Light!",

      "full_text": "This is the first poem in Bang-i-Dara representing \u2018Allamah Iqbal's nationalistic sentiments. He laments lack of amity between the Muslims and Hindus, which were the two major nations in the Indian sub-continent. His pain was aggravated by the fact that this lack of amity was delaying the independence of India from Britain. Several poems on this subject will follow. These poems have created misunderstanding about the political ideology of \u2018Allamah Iqbal. Opinion has been expressed by some responsible persons that he was initially an Indian nationalist and was only swept away by the \"separatist ideology of the Muslim League\" into what the Indian Hindus call \"communalism\". This opinion betrays complete ignorance of the works and thought of \u2018Allamah Iqbal as well as the basics of Islam. | Allamah Iqbal loved India and its natural beauty and had respect for its heroes and heroines 1. He wanted to establish Hindu-Muslim amity to hasten India's independence from Britain. However, his political ideology was not the Western style democratic system but pan-Islamism.\n\nConsumed with grief I am, I get relief in no way | O circumambient waters of the Ganges drown me\nOur land foments excessive mutual enmity | What unity !

      "full_text": "The ordinary candle is a world unto itself in Persian and Urdu literatures. It is taken as an emblem of a beloved as well as that of a lover. As a beloved the moth circles round it and eventually dies in its love. As a lover it is presented as weeping in the agony of separation from its beloved. In this poem \u2018Allamah Iqbal has equated candle with Man as both are afflicted with the agony of separation from the Creator and Beloved, i.e. God. There is, however, one difference. Man is endowed with \"feeling\", which raises him above the candle and, in fact, above all creation. This quality is a part of the attribute of Khuda 1 which has entitled Man to be endowed with knowledge, on account of which God has ranked him as the masterpiece of creation and His vicegerent on earth (The Holy Qur'an 2:30-34). Endowed with this attribute Man was transferred from Paradise to earth to witness the Jamal and Jalal of God as conveyed by the kaleidoscope of His creation and as communicated to Man through his qualities of knowledge and perception. However, this world is the temporary abode of Man and he has been charged with the mission of maintaining its beauty and protecting it from disturbances in the physical as well as spiritual spheres. To attain this goal he has been charged with the responsibility of struggling for the establishment of the Kingdom of God on earth. This commissioning of Man has been repeated at several places in the Holy Qur'an, reference to which has been provided previously. | The `Allamah says in this poem that the possession of \"feeling\" has endowed Man with compassion which is a very elegant quality. However, deceptive perception has made Man a captive of discrimination of race and color, which has resulted in his losing the joy of the universal peace which can be achieved only through the acknowledgment of the Universal Unity of God as well as that of Man and Love of both.\n\nO Candle!

      "full_text": "This poem does not portray \u2018Allamah Iqbal's escape from sophisticated society into the corner of retirement as would appear from its cursory perusal. In fact, he did not want to escape life and its problems but fight against them. This was his most important message and advice to all his readers, and particularly to Muslims. The poem is an allegorical presentation of the struggle between Intellect and Intuition. The city life, represented by worldly assemblages in the poem, stands for materialism whose benefits are obtained through Intellect. They provide material comforts but do not satisfy the heart and conscience. The life represented by the abode in the wilderness stands for life of Intuition, which harmonizes Man's existence with the orchestra of the creation of God in nature and helps him to rise in moral stature. The following verse, which is only one of numerous verses and poems on this subject sums up his feelings: | (161) Heart's freedom is sovereignty, belly is prelude to death Heart or belly, the decision of yours is in your hands.\n\nO Lord ! I have become weary of human assemblages! | When the heart is sad no pleasure in assemblages can be\nI seek escape from tumult, my heart desires | The silence which speech may ardently love!\nI vehemently desire silence, I strongly long that | A small hut in the mountain's side may there be\nFreed from worry I may live in retirement | Freed from the cares of the world I may be\nBirds' chirping may give the pleasure of the lyre | In the spring's noise may the orchestra's melody be\nThe flower bud bursting may give God's message to me | Showing the whole world to me this small wine-cup may be\nMy arm may be my pillow, and the green grass my bed be | Putting the congregation to shame my solitude's quality be\nThe nightingale be so familiar with my face that | Her little heart harboring no fear from me may be\nAvenues of green trees standing on both sides be | The spring's clear water providing a beautiful picture be\nThe view of the mountain range may be so beautiful | To see it the waves of water again and again rising be\nThe verdure may be asleep in the lap of the earth | Water running through the bushes may glistening be\nAgain and again the flowered boughs touching the water be | As if some beauty looking at itself in mirror be\nWhen the sun apply myrtle to the evening's bride | The tunic of every flower may pinkish golden be\nWhen night's travellers falter behind with fatigue | Their only hope my broken earthenware lamp may be\nMay the lightning lead them to my hut | When clouds hovering over the whole sky be .\nThe early dawn's cuckoo, that morning's mu\u2019adhdhin | May my confidante he be, and may his confidante I be\nMay I not be obligated to the temple or to the mosque | May the hut\u2019s hole alone herald of morning\u2019s arrival be\nWhen the dew may come to perform the flowers\u2019 ablution | May wailing my supplication, weeping my ablution be\nIn this silence may my heart\u2019s wailing rise so high | That for stars\u2019 caravan the clarion\u2019s call my wailing be\nMay every compassionate heart weeping with me be | Perhaps it may awaken those who may unconscious be",

      "full_text": "The introduction to the Poem 14. Sham\u2018a Awr Parwanah outlines the influence of Islam on transforming the pre-Islamic \"love\" in literary works, especially poetry from amorous love to the God\u2019s Love, the love of the Holy Prophet S.A.W and his descendants and love of Man. This resulted in the appearance of the mystical poetry of Islam. This class of poetry deals with the Love of God and Love of mankind. This love, directly or indirectly, forms the subject of many of \u2018Allamah Iqbal's poetic works. Such Love has several facets and attributes and imposes several responsibilities and duties and confers different degrees of felicity upon the Lover. These matters are contained in several poems and they will come to light as we proceed with this commentary. | One facet of such Love is the pathos of separation from the Beloved, i.e. God and the ardent Longing in the Lover's heart to establish and witness the Unity of Man in the terrestrial world, as a part of the Islamic State's ideology and the Audience with God in the spiritual world after death. According to the Holy Qur\u2019an 56:8-56, and particularly 10-11 attainment of the latter goal in the Hereafter is the highest felicity for a true Mu\u2019min . The attainment of these two super felicities require real Love without even a shadow of ostentation. The Lover is required to keep his Love concealed in his breast and this poem emphasizes this duty and obligation of the Lover. | This poem has undertones of \"Wahdat-al-Wujud\" in which `Allamah Iqbal believed earlier in his life. This theory postulates that all creation including Man is part and parcel of the same entity, i.e. the Eternal Being. Man has been separated from that Being by being born and this separation haunts him all his life. | (162) God was when nothing had been and would have been if nothing had been | Destroyed I am by being! What would I have been if I had not been | -- Ghalib\n\nO Pathos of Love! You are a glossy pearl | Beware, you should not appear among strangers\nThe theatre of your display is concealed under the veil | The modern audience' eye accepts only the visible display\nNew breeze has arrived in the Existence' garden | O Pathos of Love! Now there is no pleasure in display\nBeware! You should not be striving for ostentation! | You should not be obligated to the nightingale's lament!\nThe tulip's wine-cup should be devoid of wine | The dew's tear should be a mere drop of water\nYour secret should be hidden in the bosom somewhere | Your heart -melting tear should not be your betrayer\nThe flowery-styled poet's tongue should not be talking | Separation's complaint should not be concealed in flute's music\nThis age is a critic, go and somewhere conceal yourself | In the heart in which you are residing conceal yourself\nThe learning's surprise is neglecting you, beware! | Your immature eye is not the seeker of Truth, beware\nLet the elegant thought remain in search of Truth | Let your wisdom-loving eye remain in astonishment\nThis is not the garden whose spring you may be | This is not the audience worthy of your appearance\nThis audience is the lover of the material sights | The purpose of your sight is the closet of secrecy\nEvery heart is intoxicated with the wine of thinking | Something different is the tur of the Kalams of this age",

      "full_text": "This poem is an allegorical description of the events on the day of the starting of the Universe. It gives a very elegantly artistic description of the way everything was created according to the plan of God. However, the poem is not just an account of the flight of imagination, but a treasure house of mystic ideas. Its central theme is that all created things are bound to perish except the Love of God, which is part of His existence and is eternal (verses 11-23). This Love is one of the basic themes of \u2018Allamah Iqbal's philosophy and pervades all his poetic works. A conspectus of \u2018Allamah Iqbal's views on Love is not possible in this discussion. Only selected samples of his works can be given to show his thinking on this topic and some are given below: | (169) If self-cognizant, self-effective, and self-comprehending is the Khuda of yours | It is also possible that even death may be unable to cause the death of yours | (170) The first, the last, the concealed and the obvious are doomed to perish | Alas ! The old and the new pictures alike are doomed to perish | (171) But in that picture the color of Eternity is | Which perfected by some Man of God is\n\nThe hour of the Universe' appearance was charming | The flower-bud of life was showering smiles\nHere the golden crown, the sun was getting | There the moon its moon-light was getting\nThe dark gown to the night was being given | Training of brightness to stars was being given\nThe Existence's branch was getting leaves here | The bud of life was bursting out there\nThe angels were teaching weeping to the dew | For the first time the rose was laughing\nThey were conferring pathos on the poet's heart | Khuda for the wine of B\u00fckhuda was pining\nFor the first time dark black clouds were appearing | As if some Houri of Paradise with open hair was standing\nThe earth was claiming elegance of the sky | The space was claiming to be boundless\nIn short so beautiful the sight was | That seeing it in itself a panorama was\nThe angels their flying powers were testing | Eternal lights from their foreheads were appearing\nAn angel called Love there was | Whose guidance everyone's hope was\nThe angel who the embodiment of restlessness was | Angel among angels and restless like mercury he was\nHe was going towards the Paradise for a stroll | He met death on its way by the destiny's roll\nHe asked death, \"What is the name and work of yours? | I do not want to encounter the face of yours\"\nHearing this said the angel of death | \"My work is clear, I am the angel of death\nI shatter the chattels of existence | I extinguish the spark of life\nThe magic of annihilation is in my eyes | The message of destruction is its symhol\nBut there is one entity in the Universe | It is fire, I am only mercury before it\nIt lives in the human heart as a spark | It is the darling of the Divine Light\nIt constantly drips as tears from the eyes | The tears whose bitterness is tolerable\"\nWhen Love heard this from the death's lips , | Laughter started appearing from its lips\nThe thunder of such smile descended on death | How can darkness stay in front of such light?\nOn seeing eternity to death it fell | Death it was, to death it fell",

In their view Islam is restricted to the observance of a few formal rules of the Islamic law and that too only in the letter of the law and not in its spirit. Secondly, he wants to bring out his own universality as far as the orbit of Islamic learning is concerned. \u2018Allamah Iqbal's knowledge of and service to Islam is multi-dimensional and multi-faceted to the extent that it is difficult to say whether he was a poet, an exegesist of the Holy Qur'an, an Islamic revivalist, a philosopher, or a sufi. Study of his books will show that he was all these par excellence.

They use this \"art\" for worldly gains and respectability, and have commercialized a noble concept."

      "full_text": "Man has only the potential for reaching the high position of the Vicegerent of God on earth and needs very hard work for attaining it. This effort includes an ardent Love of God and the Holy Prophet S.A.W. Such Love would lead Man to the state of complete submission of his own will to the Will of God, to lead a life of complete devotion to God; complete self discipline and a state of the mind in which he would consider no sacrifice too great in the struggle for His Cause. For greater details attention is invited to \u2018Allamah Iqbal's two books titled Asrar-i-Khuda and Rumuz-i-Bekhuda. The net result of the loss of Khuda has led the present day Man away from submission to God and towards submission to \u00f3aghut. This has resulted in greed, jealousy, arrogance and prejudice, which are Man's cardinal sins and the root of all sins, individual as well as social, national and international. | As the re-establishment and propagation of Islamic values and the struggle for the reconstruction of Islamic society, which would struggle for and establish the super-national Islamic State, was the raison d'etre of \u2018Allamah Iqbal's poetry this thought abounds in his works, including the present poem. It is not sufficient to claim the Love of God verbally. This Love has to be demonstrated and proven by sacrifices in His Cause. \u2018Allamah Iqbal emphasizes the need for participating in the \u2018abadah in the broad sense of the term and not just personal piety and hair splitting of the intricacies of the Shara\u2018ah. He has forcefully emphasized throughout his works the need for the Love of God to be the motivation of all human efforts in order to make them effective as well as acceptable to God: | (172) All wisdom of Angelic World, all knowledge of Celestial World | If it cures not the maladies of the Islamic World is all but naught | (173) The midnight remembrance, meditations, the spiritual joys of yours | If they guard not your Khuda they are all but naught | The present poem gives some indication of what the true Love of God means. It shows that the highest dangers and the greatest losses in His Cause are imminent for those struggling therein and that, though they may lead to material losses and even loss of life, the result is the reward of eternal bliss, which only those can appreciate and enjoy whom God has endowed with such light (The Holy Qur'an 2:153-57).\n\nTales of gallows and crucifixion are mere child's play for the Heart | The request of Arina is only the title of the story of the Heart\nO Lord! How powerful the full cup of that wine would be? | The Way to eternity is each single line on the measuring cup of the Heart\nO Lord!

      "full_text": "This long poem, in eight parts, each with a different cadence, deals primarily with the slavery of the Indian sub\u2011continent and the lack of proper efforts to gain independence. The first part shows frustration and disappointment at the helplessness of ordinary men, who are without the warmth of Khuda. The second part deals with Man's inability to understand his own reality without Divine guidance. In the third part there is a hint to the poetic genius of \u2018Allamah Iqbal with which he resolves to infuse a new life in the inhabitants of India. It also shows disappointment at the political slavery of India and the state of helplessness as well as lack of struggle and planning for gaining independence. This is followed by an eloquent expression of the resolve of \u2018Allamah Iqbal to break the inaction and inertia of the Indian people. In the next two parts he deals exclusively with the ethical decline of Muslims in general and that of those of India in particular. This is followed by corrective measures in the next two parts. These measures consist of strengthening the struggle for independence and gaining strength for the same from the Love of God and ethnic amity among the different people inhabiting the Indian sub\u2011continent.\n\nMy story is not indebted to the patience of being heard | My silence is my talk, my speechlessness is my speech\nWhy does this custom of silencing exist in your assembly? | My tongue is tantalized to talk in this assembly\nSome leaves were picked up by the tulip, some by the narcissus,some by the rose | My story is scattered around everywhere in the garden\nThe turtle-doves, parrots, and nightingales pilfered away | The garden's denizens jointly robbed away my plaintive way\nO Candle!

This was due to the complete political and economic domination of European countries over Asian and African nations by the beginning of the twentieth century when this poem was written. Naturally, India could not expect any sympathy from European countries. Unfortunately, this state of affairs has not changed after one more century and no European country is sympathetic with any other country in distress, particularly Muslim countries.

      "full_text": "This short poem in three parts, different in cadence, deals with important mystic concepts through the common-place fire fly. The first part extols the beauties of the insect in different ways, and presents it as a reflection of the creative power of God. The next two parts show how the creativity of God appears in all His creatures throughout the universe, examples of which have been taken only from the common creatures and phenomena familiar to the denizens of the earth, to make the subject easily intelligible to the common man. The essence of the poem is the twin concept of Tawhad-i-Ilah (The Unity of God) and Tawhad-i-Insaniyat (The Unity of Mankind). This is mentioned in the last two verses. The coherence in the diversity of the universe points to the Unity of the Creator in the plurality of the universe.\n\nThe fire-fly's light is shining in the garden's abode | Or a candle is lighted in the assembly of flowers ?\nHas some star flown down from the sky? | Or has a moon's ray been brought to life?\nOr the emissary of the day has come to the night's kingdom? | Has become prosperous in foreign land was unknown in homeland\nHas some button fallen from the cloak of the moon? | Or some speck has become prominent in the sun's shirt?\nWas it the concealed glimpse of the Eternal Beauty? | Which was brought by Nature out of solitude into the assembly\nDarkness as well as light is in this little moon | Now it is out of eclipse, now it is in eclipse\nThe moth is an insect, as the fire-fly is an insect | The former needs light, the latter is light's embodiment\nNature gave beauty to everything in the universe | It gave agitation to moth, it gave light to fire-fly\nIt gave flowery music to the speechless bird | Having given tongue to the rose taught it to be silent\nThe beauty of twilight's spectacle was decaying | Brightening up this fairy, a short life it gave\nIt gave color to the dawn like a beautiful bride | Clothing it in red dress gave it the mirror of dew\nIt gave shade to the tree, gave flight to the wind | It gave flow to water, gave restlessness to waves\nThis distinction but is a way of our thinking | The fire-fly's day is the same as our night\nThe Eternal Beauty's reflection is present in everything | It is speech in man. It is blooming in the flower bud\nThis moon in the sky is the poet's heart so to say | It is moonlight there what here the prick of pathos is\nThe manners of speech have deceived us, otherwise | Song is nightingale's fragrance, flower's fragrance is its song\nConcealed in plurality is the secret of the Unity | What is fire-fly\u2019s brightness is flower\u2019s fragrance\nWhy should this difference be occasion for dissensions? | When the Primeval Day\u2019s silence be concealed in everything",

      "full_text": "This poem , in three parts, is yet another one in which \u2018Allamah Iqbal has established the superiority of Man above all else in the universe. In common parlance, and particularly in Urdu and Persian literature, denizens of the spiritual world are considered superior to those of the terrestrial world. Allamah Iqbal has presented the view of the Holy Qur\u2019an in which Man has been designated to be superior to all in his capacity of being the Vicegerent of God on earth. Venus, \"the morning star\", is considered to be very beautiful on account of its brilliance and visibility from the earth early in the morning and also early in the evening. For this reason it is called \"Zahrah\", i.e. \"the bright one\". In this poem Venus expresses its desire to be not only a denizen of the earth but be the one in close association with Man. This testifies to the elegance of Man. At another place \u2018Allamah Iqbal says: | (176) I have learnt from Prophet's Ascension to Celestial World | That the world of Man transcends the Celestial World | The last part of the poem describes one aspect which is characteristic of a Mu\u2019min family and is one of its virtues.\n\nShould I abandon the pleasure of sun's and moon's company? | And should I abandon this service of conveying dawn's message\nFor me the height of the world of stars is not good | For me lowliness of earth's denizens is better than this height\nWhat is the sky? Is the uninhabited homeland of mine | The tattered skirt of the morning is my shroud\nMy destiny is dying and being born every day | Drinking morning draft of wine from the hand of death's cup-bearer\nThis service, this honor, this elegance is not good | Darkness is better than this ephemeral illumination\nIf I had the power, I would have never become a planet | I would have become the shining pearl in the ocean's depth\nThere also if I would have become weary of the waves' struggle | Leaving the ocean I would have become some neck's decoration\nThe pleasure of brightness is in being some beauty's ornament | In being the ornament of the crown of the princess of Caesar\nAs the fortune of a piece of stone gained ascendancy | It did not stop short of being jewel of Sulaiman's ring\nBut breaking is the end of such things in the world | Breaking is the end of the invaluable pearls\nReal life is the one which is not acquainted with death | What good is the life in which there is demand of death?\nIf this is the end of being the decoration of the universe | Why should I not fall as dew on some flower?\nI should live as shining specks in the decoration of someone's forehead | I should live in the sparks of some oppressed person's sighs\nAs tear I be entangled in the eye lashes of someone | Why should I not drip from the eyes of that lady?\nWhose husband, clad in the chains\u2011armor is departing | To battlefield, compelled by the love of the homeland\nWho may be exhibiting hope and despair's spectacle | Whose silence may be putting speech to embarrassment\nTo whom pleasing the husband may give the strength for patience | And to whose eyes' modesty may give the power to speak\nWhose rosy cheeks at departure's time may be turned pale | Attraction of whose beauty by separation's sorrow may be enhanced\nHowever hard she may control but still I may drip | I may spill over from the cup of the tearful eye\nAfter mixing with dust I may get eternal life | And departing, I may show warmth of Love to the world",

This verse shows that a mere piece of stone gained elegance by being the stone of the ring of a man."

The seemingly heretic expressions like the one in the second verse are sarcasm against the behavior of insincere religious leaders who misuse religion for their own aggrandizement. It is also a veiled lesson to the Muslims that Islam teaches tolerance of other religions. | It is appropriate to explain here that the Indian Muslims in general and their leaders in particular, including \u2018Allamah Iqbal, tried their best, for about two decades to evolve a formula for Muslim-Hindu amity which would be acceptable to the Muslims with honor. This was necessary because the Muslims were the poorer and the less advanced component of the population of India than the Hindus. Students of history know that all the efforts of the Muslims and their leaders failed and the Hindus kept on demanding of the Muslims to sign a carte blanche in their favor. Ultimately \u2018Allamah Iqbal himself became frustrated and had to declare in his presidential address to the All\u2011India Muslim League meeting at Allahabad in 1930 that the partition of the sub\u2011continent was the only practical solution to the problem. However, the efforts at amity continued without any success till March 1940, when the All\u2011India Muslim League was compelled to pass the famous Pakistan resolution at their meeting at Lahore.\n\nMay I tell the truth O Brahman!

Raikhtah in Persian means \"mixed\", to indicate that the language was a mixture of Persian and Hindi in which the two languages were distinctly separate from each other. Amar Khusroe was one of the architects of such a language and his genius lies in doing that more successfully than others.

He can be discerned by the discerning eye with the help of Khuda. The Holy Qur'an also teaches us to understand God from the objects of the universe and Man's own self, which is Khuda. The power of Khuda distinguishes Man from and makes him superior to the rest of the creation of God. However, Knowledge or Intellect conceals Khuda and with it the Light of God fades away from Man's eyes. This Light dawns only when Man throws away the earthly mantle of Intellect and activates the Love of God. \u2018Allamah Iqbal's works are replete with this thought."

      "full_text": "Rava is one of the five major rivers forming the Indus Basin and the region of the Punjab. It passes through Lahore and is a part of its life. In this poem \u2018Allamah Iqbal is describing one of his frequent visits to the river bank. After describing the river's beauty and serene environment he passes on to the realm of higher thoughts. In the sixth and seventh verses he recapitulates a glimpse of the departed glory of Muslims during the Mughal rule in India, when Lahore was the capital of the Mughal Empire for a considerable time during the reign of Emperor Nur al\u2011Dan Jahangar (1569\u20111627, reigned 1605\u201127). However, the main lesson of the poem is contained in the last two verses, according to which death is not the end of human life but only a change of place and form. Extending this philosophy to the life of nations these verses mean that the decline and fall of the Mughal Empire is not the end of Muslims and their glory would return if they work for it again. This thought is repeated at many places in his works, including Bang-i-Dara. One such poem is 122. Walidah Marhumah Ka Yad Main (In Memory of the Blessed Late Mother). This concept forms a component of the philosophy of Khuda.\n\nIn the evening's serenity the Rava melodious is | Do not ask me what the condition of my heart is\nThis became message of prostration\u2019s rise and fall to me | The whole world became precincts of the Haram to me\nI am standing at the bank of the running water | However, I do not know where I am standing\nThe red wine has colored the skirt of the evening | The aged sky is holding wine cup in its trembling hand\nThe day's fast moving caravan is advancing to its end | The evening's twilight is the sun's flower so to say\nIn the distance those solitary structures are standing | They are the minarets of the Mughal emperors' tombs\nThis place is the tale of revolution\u2019s tyranny | This place is some book of the bygone age\nThis place is a silent orchestra so to say | Not trees !

        "greed: This is a metaphorical description of Man being separated from the path of dan on account of which he became caught in the net of greed. Accountability for deeds is a fundamental component of religion and protects Man from materialism, which is the starting point of greed. \"Garden\" is the metaphor for the peace of mind obtained from true Iman, which is what Iqbal means.",
        "been: The high position of Man made all denizens of the celestial world jealous of him, to the extent that Iblas went to the limit of disobeying God by refusing to prostrate before S. Adam A.S. Several verses of the Holy Qur'an bear witness to this, e.g. 2:34; and 7:11-18. Examples of the condemnation of jealousy are spread over all works of \u2018Allamah Iqbal but they cannot be cited here for reasons of brevity.",
        "decided?: This refers to the request of S. Musa A.S. on Mount tur to see God and the latter's refusal to grant that request (The Holy Qur'an 7:143). This verse means that God is beyond Man's comprehension and, perhaps for that reason, it says that the request of S. Musa A.S. was denied. If his request had been granted it would have been necessary for S. Musa A.S. to describe what he exactly saw, which was impossible. This is exactly what \u2018Allamah Iqbal means. Similarly, the Holy Qur'an does not say categorically that even the Holy Prophet S.A.W. saw God. (53:1-10; and 81:19-23) and for the same reason.",
        "was: This and the next verse mean that the deserving persons see God in this world also and this reward for their merits is not restricted to the Hereafter. There is no contradiction between this and the contents of Note 3. The \"sight\" cannot be measured by the muqannin's (law maker) scales or described in the faqah's words. It is a feeling and the happiness which only those can feel who deserve and experience it.",
        "was: The highest reward for piety is to witness the countenance of God and the persons alive to this human need pine for it. Lack of the fulfillment of this need and longing is a malady, which can be cured in this life as mentioned in the previous verse. However, failing that, it can be cured after death as said in this verse.",
        "colorful: In spite of the apparently lowly origin of Man from dust, he can attain high ranks as a reward for his noble deeds, just as a rose bush rising from dust produces beautiful rose flowers.",
        "was: This verse shows that God is omni-scient and sees and knows all human actions, including the extenuating circumstances which sometimes compel Man to go astray. In view of this the detailed description of the Holy Qur\u2019an and other religious literature of the procedures of accountability on the Day of Judgment do not mean that God would be collecting evidence to prove the evil deeds of a particular person. They are meant to warn Man that he should guard against evil deeds and save himself the disgrace of the Day of Judgment.",
        "was: This also is a very delicate and abstract concept of tasawwuf. According to Wahdat al-Wujud the highest reward for Man is to be able to feel the Presence of God (Note 4), when he passes from his own self into the Self of God. This is technically known as Fana fa Allah (the mystic experience of losing one's self in God) followed by Baqa Billah (the mystic experience of subsisting or living in or by God). These concepts are not easy to grasp and need guidance from a competent guide."

It is believed that he had written several other ghazals in the same style but excluded them from this book at the time of its compilation. However, such ghazals were very few and the above piece of information may be only somebody's conjecture. \u2018Allamah Iqbal was a philosopher and an Islamist more than a poet. The style of ghazal, particularly the classical ghazal, is very much restricted by the constraints of rhyming and the length of the poem. It is not suitable for conveying the extensive and deep thoughts which he wanted to convey. Hence there are very few ghazals in the classical style of Dagh. This ghazal is typically mystic and describes the attributes of the Love of God in the language of materialistic love.\n\nWhat should I say how much Longing for dejection I have | The elegance of my market is only up to the ardent desire for losing\nI am the sot who himself becomes garden by the Wine\u2019s Light | Rose\u2019s love is only up to the departure of the unkind cup bearer\nHunter\u2019s enhancement of garden\u2019s beauty is till start of my melodies | As for the thunderbolts\u2019 restlessness, it is up to my nest\nI am that handful of dust, which is changed to wilderness by distress\u2019 grace | Do not ask me of my span, it is from the earth to the sky\nI am the bell, complaint is asleep in my whole nature | The silence of mine only is up to the caravan\u2019s departure\nWith a tranquil heart create means of attaining your aims | Because the whirlpool\u2019s knot is only up to the water\u2019s flow\nSilence is death in the garden of Love, O nightingale | This life is only up to observance of the wailing\u2019s custom\nIn youth, there is Sight\u2019s zeal as well as Longing\u2019s pleasure | The happiness of our house is only up to the guest\u2019s presence\nDisgraced though I am in the whole world but, O ignorance | I understand that my Love is known only to my confidante",

        "also: Allusion to the story of Lailah and Majnun. Majnun gave up living in human habitations and started roaming about in the wilderness. The Lover of God is advised to abandon wilderness also. This is so because it is immaterial for a Lover of God whether he lives in habitations or in the wilderness as God is independent of space and time and is omni-present. The Lover will find Him anywhere and everywhere provided his Love is selfless and sincere.",
        "taqlad: Taqlad. Literally it means following the accepted path. In \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s terminology it means blind following of traditions.",
        "Khizr: Khizar. Traditionally he is believed to guide the wayfarers who have gone astray.",
        "\u2018ibadat: \u2018Ibadat. This is wrongly understood to mean \"worship\" and formal prayers and the latter are considered to be the climax of piety. This word is derived from the root \u2018abd, which literally means a \"slave\" or \"servant\". In the Holy Qur\u2019an \u2018abd designates the nature, status and destiny of Man, that he is a slave of God and is neither Divine nor has any share in the Powers and Rights of God. According to this his destiny is \u2018Abdiyat, \u2018Ubudiyat, or bondage. He is required to be a perfect servant or \"abd\". In Persian and Urdu \" \u2018abdiyat\" is more commonly used than \u2018Ubudiyat. Bandah and bandaga are the Persian equivalents of \u2018abd and \u2018Ubudiyat respectively. \u2018Ibadat really means obedience with absolute self-surrender and humility. It includes worship, reverence, and prayer but is really comprised of honesty and sincerity to God in all phases and departments of life. The second line of this verse means that only the Love of God should be the motive force for a Mu\u2019min\u2019s virtuous actions. It is not a trade in which one offers his merchandise and expects a reward as its price. Only that piety is acceptable to God which is performed without the desire for thawab.",
        "also: See \"The Controversy of \u2018Aql and Dil\" for a discussion of Intuition and Intellect.",
        "also: It is not clear whether the proof is meant for the virtues of abstention from drinking or that of drinking. In either case the verse shows strong doubts in the mind of \u2018Allamah Iqbal about the sincerity of the half-baked \u2018Ulama. If the former interpretation is taken it means that unless the preacher himself gives up drinking his preaching cannot be taken as serious. This would mean that such \u2018Ulama do not practice what they preach. If the latter interpretation is accepted it would mean that if such an \u2018alim supports drinking the \u2018Allamah would doubt his sincerity and would give up drinking."

Other attributes of the different objects mentioned in this verse are signs of their perfection in the same way. The rotatory and revolutionary movements of all bodies in the universe in their fixed orbits is described metaphorically as their search for the Truth of the Beloved, i.e. God. This Love has made the universe operate the way it does. It is a fact that the force of mutual attraction of all these bodies, i.e. gravity keeps the balance between them.

Swama Ram Tarath had a very brilliant career and passed all public examinations from High School to M.A. in Mathematics in the first division. He worked in different capacities during the period 1895-99 at the American Mission High School at Sialkot and Foreman Christian College at Lahore. He also worked at the latter institution as Alexander Fellow for a short period. He soon resigned and devoted himself to the study, practice, and teaching of the Hindu Vedant philosophy. One component of it is oath of celibacy. The Swama could not keep this oath when he went to the United States for preaching. He soon returned to India without his family and died by drowning in 1906, while bathing in River Ganga at Hardwar, one of the Holy places of Hindus. It is said to be an act of atonement for his sin of marriage. | The poem pays tribute to him, calling him a drop which united with the ocean in a way similar to the union of Man on death with God, according to the Vedant philosophy. The poem also deals with the broader share of Tawhad and ardent Love of God. It explains how the secrets of the universe are disclosed to Man through this Love, which can be exercised without the intermediation of religious bureaucracy and institutions, like temple, church etc. Such institutions divide humanity into classes which discriminate against each other. The true Love of God, represented by \"The Temple of God \" is above all these considerations.\n\nO Impatient drop !

However, in the last verse there is the warning that as the Love of the Muslim youth for God was till then immature and their self-confidence was still not fully developed they had to remove these shortcomings before launching their struggle.\n\nThe message of others is different, my message is different | The style of address of the one afflicted with Love is different\nYou have heard the laments of the bird under the net | Also listen to the laments of the bird on the roof tops which are different\nCall was coming from the mount, \"Life\u2019s secret is peace\" | The frail ant was saying \"The pleasure of struggle is different\"\nThe glory of Hijaz\u2019 assemblage is based on Haram\u2019s Love | The station of this is different, the system of that is different!\nEternal luxury is death if there is no Longing for Search | Man\u2019s revolving is different, wine-cup\u2019s revolving is different\nThe dawn\u2019s candle left the message that burning is life\u2019s secret | In the life\u2019s sorrowful abode the condition for eternity is different\nThe wine is still half-mature, Love is unsuccessful still | Leave the church\u2019s brick on the pitcher\u2019s mouth still",

      "full_text": "This poem is a very artistic exposition of one aspect of the theory of \"Wahdat al\u2011Wujud\" . According to this theory God existed before the creation of the universe. The creation of the universe was only the appearance of the same entity in tangible forms. These forms appear different to the un\u2011initiated eye but to the eye with insight they are the same One God. As long as a man is not born he lives in the Presence of God, of which he is a component and which is the real object of his Love. The act of being born and sent to the earth is separation from the object of his Love, i.e. God and the source of his afflictions. Now man will remain separated from God till his death. According to this concept Man's afflictions are the products of this separation. However, they would disappear after death or if and when one has reached the stage in which he can see God in the objects of the universe, which he can achieve through real \"Ibadah\", i.e. subservience to God in the comprehensive sense enjoined by Islam. This thought is expressed in Part 2 of the poem, starting with verse 6 and reaches its climax in the last verse. This is the stage which is known as \"Fana Fillah\", leading to \"Baqa Billah\". It is in this condition that the veils of materialism are lifted from the human eye and the Truth becomes manifest to him. (See verse 2 of ghazal 50\u20117 for clarification). This thought occurs in many places in the works of `Allamah Iqbal.\n\nO Nightingale!

These were Salmah, Lubnah, Sulaima, Lailah etc. This poetic tradition continued and was strengthened by Islamic poets also, particularly the sufa poets. However, the difference was that God and/or the Holy Prophet S.A.W became the focus of their Love instead of humans. The tradition of using legendary beauties was also adopted by \u2018Allamah Iqbal. He has usually adopted the name of Sulaima in his works. | This poem is the artistic presentation of the concept of \"Wahdat al\u2011Shuhud \". The essence of the poem is that though the Jamal and Jalal of God is reflected in all His creation it is found par excellence in the human beauty, because Man is the master\u2011piece of His creation.

In the first part `Allamah Iqbal mentions the apparent contradictions in his character, in that he claims to love God but is also involved in the love of many created objects, including human beings. In the second part he explains that there is no contradiction in his claim, and that the appreciation and love of created objects exists only on account of his Love for God and leads him towards his ultimate goal. This poem is a continuation of the previous one. This thought can be extended to any person who is a true Mu'min. Such a person's love for God's creation is really a reflection of his Love for God.\n\n(Part 1)\nO Iqbal ! You are a strange mixture of opposites | You are the elegance of assembly\u2019s crowd as well as alone\nO lunatic with colorful song ! Your struggles and efforts | Are the garden\u2019s beauty as well as wilderness\u2019 adornment\nYou are the associate of stars due to your flight\u2019s elegance | O land traveler your steps also traverse the sky\nYour forehead is in prostration in the midst of preoccupation with wine | In your system are some colors of the system of goblets also\nLike flower\u2019s fragrance you are devoid of color\u2019s dress | Though you are a creator of wisdom you are also insane\nLike waves you are running to the destination without foot-prints | And then you are also left behind like the sea-shore\nFemale beauty has the effect of electricity for your nature | And strangely enough your loves are unconventional also\nYour existence depends on the amusement\u2019s law | Are you prostrating only at a single door step?\nAmong the beautiful you are famous for infidelity | O fickle-minded! You are famous as well as infamous\nYou have come into the world with mercury\u2019s nature | Your restlessness is lovable, you are very restless\n(Part-2)\nWhat the disturbance of love has turned into wilderness | I keep that handful of dust concealed under the cloak\nIt has thousands of facets, each of a different color | I keep such a multi-faceted diamond in my breast\nThe poet\u2019s heart, is but intoxication\u2019s toil and hustle | What do you know, what I keep inside my breast!\nIn every intoxication of Love there is a new effulgence of Longing | I am restless, I have a heart unacquainted with rest\nThough a new beauty every moment is the sight\u2019s object | I have a firm covenant of fidelity with the Beauty\nBeniaza has created my nature's Niaz | I keep the struggle for the Longing like the zephyr\nThe spectacle of a single flying spark | Cannot be assuasive as I have a thunderous heart\nWhat may fulfill every demand of the nature of Love | Ah! Attainment of that Perfect Effulgence is my aim\nThe search for the Whole misguides me into It\u2019s parts | The Beauty is boundless, I have the incurable pathos\nMy life depends upon Love's extreme compassion | But I keep the Love free of customs of fidelity\nThe truth is that lack of imagination produces fidelity | I have a new Resurrection Day ever fresh in my heart\nCup\u2011bearer's bounty is like dew, heart's capacity demands oceans | I am always thirsty, I have a burning fire under my foot\nBy creating me He created His own critic | As a picture, I have complaint against my Painter\nIf the Beauty was so short\u2011lived in existence' assembly | Why then do I keep such a boundless imagination?\nI am constantly struggling in the Longing's wilderness | I am the ocean's wave, I carry my destruction on my shoulder",

He calls this desire, and the efforts to achieve it, as the very source of real life. The climax is reached in the fifth verse according to which God Himself is anxious to manifest Himself to Man but it is only the human effort which would reveal Him to an individual, if the latter so desires and works for. This is a message to the Muslim youth to develop the philosophy of life in which the goal is unattainable. Outwardly, any effort at achieving such a goal appears futile but it is not so in reality. Really speaking it is not the goal but the longing which is never satisfied.\n\nThe dawn is vexed by separation from the sun | The twilight's eye is raining blood for the evening star\nThe day's Qais has the pining for the night's Lailah | The morning star is restless for perpetual radiance\nThe sky's polar star was saying to the stars' caravan | \"Companions !

As God is the Highest and Most Supreme Existence, His Love is the source of trials and tribulations as well as that of joy and happiness of the highest order, which can be felt and appreciated only by those who are so graced by Him.

      "full_text": "This is another short poem which is highly mystical and difficult to understand. Tasawwuf is based on the inability of the human Intellect to comprehend the marvels and mysteries of the celestial and spiritual worlds. Matters like the Existence of God can be argued for and against with Intellect and logic. Its logic can be understood with the study of \"Anfus o Afaq\" to which the Holy Qur'an has repeatedly referred for this purpose. Spiritual philosophers and sufis have adjudged God as \"Wajib al-Wujud\" (the Being whose Existence is essential for the creation and operation of the universe). However, His Dhat (Essence) is incomprehensible and indescribable. For that reason the Islamic system has established ninety nine names, which are really attributes, by which we can get some feeling for His Nature, but not knowledge. `Ibadah, in the broad sense and meditation can enable a person to feel His Essence. Similarly, other spiritual objects, like Paradise and Hell are beyond human comprehension, and their nature can only be felt, rather than described. The Holy Qur'an and Hadith literatures have used highly metaphorical language so as to make the subject somewhat intelligible to the persons of average intelligence. Any other kind of description would have been intelligible to the super or ultra-intellectuals only, if at all. Furthermore, it would have led to perpetual arguments and schisms among Muslims as has happened in other religions, based on philosophies. With this in the background of his thoughts \u2018Allamah Iqbal warns us in this poem, in a sarcastic style, that literal explanations of the descriptions of spiritual objects in the Holy Qur'an and Hadith literatures on these matters can lead to gross misunderstanding, particularly in the young and immature minds. \u2018Ibadah and meditation are the only means of getting some feeling of these subjects. The following excerpt discusses resurrection and its aftermath: | \u201cThe point, however, which has caused much difference of opinion among Muslim philosophers and theologians is whether the re\u2011emergence of Man involves the re\u2011emergence of his former physical medium. Most of them, including Shah Wali Allah, the last great theologian of Islam, are inclined to think that it does involve at least some kind of physical medium suitable to the ego's new environment. It seems to me that this view is mainly due to the fact that the ego, as an individual, is inconceivable without some kind of local reference or empirical background. The Holy Qur'an 50:3,4 throw some light on this point. | 'What ! When dead and turned to dust, shall we rise again ? Remote is such a return'. Now know what the earth consumeth and what with us is as a book in which account is kept .\u2019 | To my mind these verses clearly suggest that the nature of the universe is such that it is open to it to maintain in some other way the kind of individuality necessary for the final working of human action, even after the disintegration of what appears to specify his individuality in his present environment. What that other way is we do not know. Nor do we gain any further insight into the nature of the 'second creation' by associating it with some kind of body, however subtle it may be. The analogies of the Holy Qur\u2019an only suggest it as a fact; they are not meant to reveal its nature and character. Philosophically speaking, therefore , we cannot go further than this \u2011 that in view of the past history of Man it is highly improbable that his career should come to an end with the dissolution of his body. | However, according to the teaching of the Holy Qur'an the ego's re\u2011emergence brings him a \"sharp sight\" whereby he clearly sees his \"self\u2011built fate fastened round his neck\" (50:21-22) (read with 17:13). Heaven and Hell are states, not localities. The descriptions in the Holy Qur'an are visual representations of an inner fact, i.e. character. Hell, in the words of the Holy Qur\u2019an, is ' God's kindled fire which mounts above the heart ' ! -- \u00adthe painful realization of one's failure as a Man. Heaven is the joy of triumph over the forces of disintegration. There is no such thing as eternal damnation in Islam. The word 'eternity' used in certain verses, relating to Hell, is explained by the Holy Qur\u2019an itself to mean only a period of time (78:23). Time cannot be wholly irrelevant to the development of personality. Character tends to become permanent; its re\u2011shaping must require time. Hell, therefore, as conceived by the Holy Qur\u2019an is not a pit of everlasting torture inflicted by a revengeful God; it is a corrective experience which may make a hardened ego once more sensitive to the living breeze of Divine Grace. Nor is Heaven a holiday. Life is one and continuous. Man marches always onwards to receive ever fresh illuminations from an Infinite Reality, 'which every moment appears in a new glory'. And the recipient of Divine Illumination is not merely a passive recipient. Every act of free ego creates a new situation, and thus offers further opportunities of creative unfolding.\"\n\nYou should not tell me, \"Death is a message of luxury and pleasure\" | You should not draw the picture of Sharab-i-tuhur's ecstasy \u00ad\nDo not feel grieved by separation from the Houri | Do not present the Houri in the mirror of words\nDo not make me fascinated by the beautiful cup\u2011bearer | Do not describe the Houri, do not relate the Salsabal\u2019s story\nI do not doubt Paradise being the place of peace | Your message is not proper for the life's prime!\nAh!

I am Naz, you should become Niaz | I am the Ghaznavi of heart's Somnath, you completely become Ayaz\nGreatness in the world is not associated with the Alexander\u2019s splendor | Your breast has everything, you should also become the maker of mirrors\nThe aim of life's struggle is perfection of your Crescent's grandeur | You are the world's oldest Divine Command, be fulfilled like prayer\nBe not contented, O gardener, your dignity is established by this alone | If flowers abound in the garden, you should become a more ardent beggar\nGone are those days, these are not the times for wandering in wilderness | Become melted in the world like the congregation's lighted candle\nThe individual's existence is unreal, the nation's existence is real | Be devoted to the nation, become destroyer of the unreal's magic\nIqbal ! These sectarians of India are working like Azar | Saving your skirt from idols become the dust of the way of Hijaz",

As a Mu\u2019min has the potential for making the mirror he has also the potential for attaining greatness.",
        "prayer: This is a reminder to the Muslim Ummah that they are the vice\u2011gerents of God on earth and for that reason are charged with the responsibility of establishing the sovereignty of God on earth. It is a reminder to them that they should rise to their responsibilities and achieve what is expected of them.",

      "full_text": "This poem is complementary to the previous one. It resulted from two things. One was \u2018Allamah Iqbal's deep first hand knowledge of the apparent and material prosperity and the outward courtesy of the Western people, but their moral and ethical bankruptcy. The second was the Western nations' inherent hatred for and their machinations against the Muslim world, which resulted in the latter's decline. These feelings attained their climax when he reached the Island of Sicily on his return journey to India. | Sicily had been conquered by the Aghlabad Dynasty of Tunisia in the early ninth century and was ruled by them as well as by other Arab dynasties till it was conquered back by the Normans in the second half of the eleventh century. This poem has resulted from the flood of thoughts which must have streamed through his mind on reaching the Island of Sicily. The sight of the island brought back to his mind the Muslim world with its glory in ethical as well as social, economic and political fields. The Muslim world, which at one time was spread over northern Africa, southern Europe, central, southern and south\u2011eastern Asia and was the cradle of the highest civilization of all times, and in moral and ethical spheres, was the highest power, had crumpled down by his time. This sight must have brought to his mind the whole panorama of the period of Muslim suzerainty in Africa and southern Europe. After the Norman conquest of Sicily the Muslim world and society have experienced constant decline which has continued till today. In contrast with the memory of the past glory must have passed his mind the extremely poor condition of the Muslim world in his time. This reminiscence must have made \u2018Allamah Iqbal very painfully sad as is evident from the verses of this poem. | At that time little did \u2018Allamah Iqbal know that the Muslim Ummah would have to go through much more afflictions than imagined at that time, till he cried out in 1924: | Rendered cheap like water is the blood of the Muslim | You are agitated as your heart is not aware of the secret | More perturbing than the affliction itself was his life\u2011long realization which poured out of his afflicted heart in 1935: | What an outrage, extinguished is the Love's fire | The Muslim is no more than a heap of burnt ashes !\n\nO blood-dripping eye!

This thought is contained in verses 1,2,4,6,7,8, and 12. However, this Longing requires ethical and spiritual elegance. Those who do not have this elegance cannot be benefited from this Longing (verse 3). Such people have the longing only for the material objects of life (verses 5 and 10). People who have the Longing for the Truth get the spiritual fulfillment of life and, among other things, are liable to appreciate the Unity of God in the diversity of His creation (verses 11 and 12). Two verses, 9 and 13, are personal. The former is a sarcasm on the people who do not understand him and so disregard or even condemn him. The latter is also the closing verse to express his goodwill to his relatives and friends. | The contradiction between verse 2 and 13 is only apparent.

      "full_text": "This ghazal was written in 1907, i.e. about the end of `Allamah Iqbal's stay in Europe. It is the first expression of his thoughts based on his experiences in Europe. The ghazal covers several of his favorite themes. There was a time when, as a result of the knowledge spreading from Islamic Spain, Europe was starting to be freed from the theocracy of the Roman Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire, which had kept Europe enslaved in bondage of ignorance for centuries. Europe was beginning to benefit from the Reformation and Industrial Revolution. New discoveries in material sciences as well as metaphysics were beginning to show promise that Europe would benefit ethically from the blessings of knowledge. \u2018Allamah Iqbal also was somewhat impressed by this situation as is reflected by verses 1\u20113 and 10. He also got some hope of the renaissance of the Muslim world as a result of the new general awakening, as is expressed in verses 4 and 5. However, he was not completely dazed by the apparent material progress of Europe, and tempered his earlier expressed optimism with the material of verses 7\u20119 and 12. The rest of the ghazal briefly talks about some of the Islamic values which have been repeatedly preached by him. These are: | (i) The supremacy of the Heart over Intellect (verse 11). Also see Note 8 to Poem 73 \"\u2018Abd al\u2011Qadir Key Nam (Addressed to Abd al\u2011Qadir) and Introduction to ghazal 75\u20115. | (ii) Love of humanity is of prime importance for piety and religion (verse 13). | (iii) Avoiding ostentation, and practicing perseverance and selflessness is very important in Love for God (verses 14\u201116). | (iv) Expression of his own ambition for participation in the important task of struggle for Islam's revival and renaissance (verse 15). The ghazal ends with an expression of his own condition. (verse 17).\n\nTime has come for openness, Beloved's Sight will be common | The secret which silence had concealed, will be unveiled now\nO Cup\u2011bearer! Time has gone when wine was taken secretly | The whole world will be tavern, everyone will be drinking\nThose who once wandered insane, will return to habitations | Lovers' wandering will be the same but deserts will be new\nThe Hijaz\u2019 silence has proclaimed to the waiting ear at last | The covenants established with desert's inhabitants will be re\u2011affirmed\nWhich coming out of deserts had overturned the Roman Empire | I have heard from the Qudsis that the same lion will be re-awakened\nAs the cup\u2011bearer mentioned me in the wine\u2011drinkers' assembly | The tavern's sage said, \"He is insolent, he will be disgraced\"\nO Western world's inhabitants, God's world is not a shop! | What you are considering genuine, will be regarded counterfeit\nYour civilization will commit suicide with its own dagger | The nest built on the frail branch will not be durable\nThe caravan of the feeble ants will make fleet of rose petals | However strong the ocean waves' tumult be it will cross the ocean\nThe poppy, roaming in the garden, shows its spots to every f lower-bud | Knowing that by this exhibition it will be counted among the Lovers\nO Sight!

      "full_text": "The rise and fall of he Muslim Ummah was a very favorite topic with \u2018Allamah Iqbal. His pride at the achievements of the Ummah during the period of its glory knew no bounds, and similar was his grief at its decline and degeneration down to his days. The latest wound to his heart was the destruction of the Uthmaniyah Khilafah and its dismemberment into secular nation states. This tragedy was, in a great measure, brought about by the untimely rebellion of the Arab world, which can only be called a treason. However, the purpose of bringing both these aspects to the Muslim Ummah\u2019s attention was to remind it of its past glory and to persuade it to start the difficult but not impossible task of reformation which would lead to its rejuvenation and renaissance. This poem is one such effort, and deals with just one aspect of the Islamic civilization, viz. the grandeur of its cities.\n\nThe region of Delhi is adored by my grieved heart | In every speck of it the ancestors\u2019 blood is asleep\nWhy should not the land of this desolate garden be holy? | This region is the shrine of the grandeur of Islam\nKings of the Khair al-Umam are asleep in this land | Dependent on whose rule remained the world order\nMemory of assembly\u2019s warmth still renders the heart restless | The splendor has been burnt but memory of the splendor is still secure\nThough Jahanabad also is a shrine for the Muslim | Baghdad as well is deserving of this magnificence\nThis is the garden the source of whose pride was | The wild tulip which was called the culture of Hijaz\nWhy should not the dust of this habitation be equivalent to Iram | Which witnessed the footsteps of the Prophet\u2019s successors\nThe garden whose flower buds were the garden\u2019s wealth is this | The grave yard of those who made Rome tremble is this\nThe land of Qurtubah also is the light of the Muslim\u2019s eye | Which shined in Europe\u2019s darkness like the candle of tur\nExtinguishing of this lamp dispersed the assembly of Millat-i-Baiza | And lighted the lamp of the present day\u2019s materialistic civilization\nThis holy region is the grave of that civilization | With which the life blood still exists in the veins of Europe\u2019s vines\nThe tract of Constantinople that is the Caesar\u2019s city | The perpetual banner of the grandeur of the Ummah\u2019s Mahda\nLike the Haram\u2019s dust this region is also holy | It is the shrine of descendants of Shah-i-Lawlak\nIts breeze is holy like the fragrance of rose | A voice is calling from the tomb of Ayyub Ansara\n\u201cO Muslim! this city is the heart of the Nation of Islam ! | This city is the reward for millenniums of blood sacrifices!\u201d\nBut you are that land, O the resting place of Mustafa | Even to the Ka`bah whose sight is better than Hajj-i-Akbar\nIn the world\u2019s ring you are shining like a gem | Your land was the birth place of our grandeur\nThat Magnificent Emperor got rest in your midst | Under whose protection the world nations got security\nWhose successors became rulers of world\u2019s empires | Became successors of Caesar, inheritors of Jam\u2019s throne\nIf the Muslim nationalism is restricted to place | Neither India nor Persia nor Syria is its base\nAh Yathrib!

        "Delhi: Delhi- Delhi was also called Shahjahanabad or Jahanabad after its re-establishment by the famous Mughal Emperor, Shahjahan (reigned 1627-57). Except for short periods of time it was the capital of several Muslim dynasties for a period of 664 years from 1193 to 1857. It was conquered by Sul\u00e8an Qu\u00e8b al-Dan Aibak in 1193 who made it his capital, and was lost to the British in 1857 after the unfortunate defeat of the India\u2019s freedom fighters in the first war of independence. During this long period it was not only the political capital of the Muslim India but was also a showpiece of their cultural, social and intellectual progress and achievements. It was not only the seat of some of the best and most powerful emperors of India, as is exhibited by its buildings and other historical relics, but was also the rendezvous of the best spiritual, ecclesiastical and temporal scholars of the world. Qureshi (1942) says, \u201c It is now being gradually recognized that the Sultanate was a part of the greater world of Islam, that it possessed intimate sources of knowledge about the rest of the Muslim world, in particular the Eastern lands, and that the history and institutions of the empire of Delhi cannot be properly understood if they are separated from the general background of Islamic History.\u201d (p. vi). \u201c Delhi became the most enlightened city of the East and the fame of the Sultanate spread into the four corners of the Muslim world\u201d (p. 5). This status of Delhi entitles it to be the starting point of this poem.",

      "full_text": "This short and apparently simple nature poem contains the very important subject of the origin, nature and end of matter. It has been controversial since the time of Aristotelian logic whether matter is hadith or qadam. Sophisticated arguments exist on both sides. However, far from solving the problem they have left the readers confused and arguing with each other. This is one of the enigmas for comprehending which Divine guidance is needed. The Holy Qur\u2019an states that (i) matter is no eternal but has been created by God, is constantly changing in form and is being re-created, and (ii) though matter has not been destroyed since its creation it will be destroyed on the Last Day. (The Holy Qur\u2019an 10:4; 14:48; 17:49; 21:104; 27:60-66; 29:19-20; and 35:16.) The climax of the thesis is reached in the last verse of the poem. \u2018Allamah Iqbal has dealt with this matter in several poems. Cf. | (196) This universe is perhaps still being completed | Because the call of \u201dKun fa Yakun \u201d is still echoing | (197) Mere optical illusion is this quietude | Restless is every speck of the universe | The constant appearance of new forms of life at all taxonomic levels of plants and animals and the constant appearance of new stars. constellations and galaxies testify to the correctness of the first verse. Similarly, the constant movement of matter along fixed orbits from the sub-atomic elementary particles to the planets, stars, constellations and galaxies supports the second verse.\n\nAre you afraid of the moon or the dawn? | Are you conscious of the end of beauty?\nAre you afraid of being robbed of light\u2019s wealth? | Are you afraid of annihilation like the spark?\nThe sky has settled you far from the earth | It has wrapped you in gold\u2019s mantle like the moon\nIt is outrageous that your feeble life is still in fear | Your whole night passes in trembling with fear\nO shining traveler! This habitation is strange | The rise of one leads to the fall of the other\nThe birth of one sun is the death of a myriad stars | Annihilation\u2019s sleep is the ecstasy of life\u2019s wine\nFlower bud\u2019s departure is the secret of flower\u2019s birth | Is annihilation life\u2019s end, or is the equivalent of life!\nQuiescence is difficult in the universe | Only change is permanent in the universe",

The amazement is satisfied in the last four verses according to which all creation, irrespective of it\u2019s beauty and station in the universe is ephemeral and is destined to die or be annihilated."

      "full_text": "This and the previous poem, named \u201cStar\u201d are complementary to each other. Stars are the units or building blocks of the universe. They are marvels of the creation of God. The history of astronomy shows that the marvels and mysteries of the universe have always baffled mankind. The greatest marvel of the universe is it\u2019s organization and the coherence of the celestial bodies which constitute it. This is created by the mutual attraction of stars or gravity divinely conferred upon them. \u2018Allamah Iqbal has frequently alluded to this phenomenon in his works, often as a lesson to the Muslim Ummah to acquire the virtue of mutual love among it\u2019s constituents to create and maintain the coherence and continuity of the Islamic society. | Just as the universe is a coherent and well-organized entity the Holy Qur\u2019an , which is another marvel of the creation of God, is also a masterpiece of logical order of it\u2019s constituents. Though the Holy Qur\u2019an was revealed to the Holy Prophet S.A.W. over a period of 23 years, it\u2019s compilation and organization in the present form was done by the Holy Prophet S.A.W. himself under Divine guidance. Comprehensive overview of the Holy Qur\u2019an shows that its surahs (chapters) and ayat (verses) within the surahs are not haphazardly arranged as alleged by Islam\u2019s enemies due to ignorance or prejudice. Indeed these parts follow a distinct logical order, which is more helpful to it\u2019s study than chronological order, which is often suggested by western scholars. | \u2018Allamah \u2018Abd Allah Yusuf \u2018Ala has very ably shown this orderly arrangement as well as it\u2019s logic in his Introduction to the relevant surahs. He has recognized 14 groups of surahs and has shown how these groups are arranged in a logical sequence and how the surahs in each group are similarly arranged. These groups are ; Surahs 1-7; 8-16; 17-21; 22-25; 26-28; 29-32; 33; 34-39; 40-46; 47-49; 50-56; 57-66; 67-94; and 95-114. Perusal of Introductions to the first surah of each group clarifies the above assertion. In addition to these groups certain surahs are arranged in pairs. In such surahs the continuation of the subject matter is shown or suggested by a cue-word, e.g. surahs 33-34, 45-46, 52-53. | The poem under study alludes to the last of the three pairs referred to above. In these surahs the continuity is shown by the word \u201cstar\u201d in the last verse of surah 52 corresponding to \u201cstars\u201d in the first verse of surah 53. Consequently, this pair of surahs is called \u201cZahrawatain\u201d or \u201cThe Two Bright Ones\u201d. The central theme of surah 52 (Al-tur or The Mount) is that the Revelation of the Holy Qur\u2019an, as that of the previous scriptures, is in accord with all the signs of God, and that the here-after is irresistible and we must prepare for it. The theme of Surah 53 (Al-Najm or The Star) is that as God is the source of all things, including Revelation, the latter is not an illusion. Illusion is in the minds of those with weak or no Iman. The central theme of these two surahs is expressed in the poem\u2019s last verse, i.e. the destruction of the universe in it\u2019s present form is inevitable and that all those existing in this universe in company will separate and will be severally responsible for their deeds. It will also be noticed that the subject matter of this poem and the previous one is continuous. | In a later edition of Bang-i-Dara the first hemistich of the first verse is written with the vowel sign, kasrah or zer, in the third word, reading it as \u201cqiran\u201d, meaning \u201cconjunction of stars\u201d. If this reading is adopted the meaning and message of the poem still remains as related above, with emphasis on the last paragraph of the same. There will be a little change in the translation of the first verse which should read as follows: | As two stars appeared in the Qiran together | One started saying to the other | However, in this case the stated meaning is far-fetched and indirect, for which reason I would prefer the first version, i.e. \u201cQur\u2019an\u201d.\n\nAs two stars came together in the Holy Qur\u2019an | One started saying this to the other\n\u201cHow excellent if this union together be permanent | How excellent if the end be walking together\nIf the sky becomes slightly favorable | We two will be with similar glow\u201d\nBut this longing for the union proved | Completely a message of the end of the union\nRevolution is the destiny of the stars | For each its special orbit is fixed\nThe permanence of union is a mere dream | The rule of the universe is separation !",

      "full_text": "This long poem of ten stanzas is the expression of \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s feelings on visiting some royal cemetery. Though the thoughts expressed in the poem could have resulted from visit to any royal cemetery it is obvious from the fourth stanza that the cemetery was a Muslim one, which could be in his native city of Lahore or in Delhi, or even in Spain. The poem starts with expression of grief which is commonly experienced by people visiting any commentary. After describing the grandeur of the kings buried there feelings of admonition are expressed on their helplessness after death, from which they cannot return to their life. The story of the rise, decline and fall of nations teaches the same lesson. The history of the Islamic Ummah is no exception. However, the fall of this nation is reflected in his thoughts as specially painful for reasons which have been explained in other poems. Nevertheless, as is usual with him, he finishes the poem with a message of hope in the last verse.\n\nThe sky is clothed in the cloud\u2019s old tattered robe | The mirror of moon\u2019s forehead is somewhat gloomy\nThe moon light is pale in this silent panorama | The dawn is sleeping in the lap of the night\nHow astonishing is silence of the trees | This silence is the soft tune of Nature\u2019s harp\nThe heart of every speck of the universe is pathos embodied | And the silence is a sad sigh on the lips of existence\nAh !

      "full_text": "This short but beautiful poem does not represent Muslim chauvinism as is alleged by Islam\u2019s enemies. On the other hand, its four-fold message to mankind in general and to Muslims in particular is based on the Holy Qur\u2019an and covers four important subjects. These are (i) universality of Islam, (ii) Mission of the Holy Prophet S.A.W., (iii) Struggle, including fighting, if necessary, in the cause of truth and defense of the weak and the oppressed, (iv) Islamic values. The universality of Islam is evidenced in the Holy Qur\u2019an in which God always calls Himself \u201cRabb-ul-Alaman\u2019\u2019 (Lord of the whole universe and not that of Muslims or of any race or nation). This message is interspersed throughout the Holy Qur\u2019an. It is contained in verses 1, 4, 7 and 8 of the poem. Verse 2 carries the second message which is based on the Holy Qur\u2019an. 9:33\u00ac; 27:91-93; 30:30; 48:8-10, 28\u00ac and 61:9\u00ac, of which the three marked with asterisk are very significant. The third message is very important and is oft repeated in the Holy Qur\u2019an (2:190-193, 216, 244; 4:74-76, 84; 8:39, 65; 9:5, 6, 12-16, 19, 20, 29, 33, 81-85, 123; 22:39-41, 78; 25:52; 29:69; 47:4, 20-21; 48:17, 28 and 61: 9. Verses 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the poem contain this message. The whole Qur\u2019an is the exposition of Islamic values. Verses 2, 3, 10 and 11 of the poem contain this thought. For these reasons the poem is very popular among Muslims and is memorized by young boys and girls.\n\nChina and Arabia are ours, India is also ours | We are Muslims, whole world is homeland of ours\nThe trust of Divine Unity is in the breasts of ours | It is not easy to destroy the identity of ours\nAmong the world\u2019s temples that first House of God | We are its sentinels, it is the sentinel of ours\nWe have been brought up under the shade of swords | The crescent\u2019s dagger is the national insignia of ours\nOur Adhan echoed in the valleys of the West | None could stop the advancing flood of ours\nWe cannot be bowed down by falsehood, O sky | Hundreds of times you have done tests of ours\nO garden of Andalus !

      "full_text": "Though the decline of the Muslim world and society can be traced back to the replacement of Khilafah-i- Rashidah by the monarchist rule of special dynasties, the last three hundred years have seen the constant fall of the Muslim world, which reached its lowest ebb after the first World War. The latter period witnessed the crumbling down of the last vestiges of the Khilafah and the complete fragmentation and subjugation of the Muslim world by its perpetual adversaries in the Western world. | This deplorable state of affairs touched the hearts of many Muslim intellectuals all over the world, including the Indian sub-continent. These intellectuals started probing into the causes of the decline of Muslims and attempted to devise means of stopping and reversing it. Though these thinkers were richly endowed with Islamic learning and were fully aware of the virtues and blessings of Islam they were unaware of the poisons in the Western thought and society which damaged Muslim society most. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, helped by the unique combination of the deep and profound knowledge of Islam as well as that of the world affairs and Western learning, stands out prominently among Muslim reformers as the one fully conversant with the strengths as well as the weaknesses of the Muslim world. The achievements of the Muslim world in all fields during the first eight centuries of the Islamic era and its ascendancy over Europe are well known. This was the result of some qualities and virtues of the Muslims of those times. When the downfall of the Muslim world started it proceeded unabated till only very recent years when the tide appeared to be turning. Determination of the causes of this degeneration is the sine qua non for Islamic renaissance. \u2018Allamah Iqbal, true to the epithet of Hakam-i-Millat (the Millat\u2019s sage or physician) spent the major part of his genius in investigating the causes of this downfall and in creating the consciousness of the situation in the Muslim mind. In addition to the damage caused by the machinations of the West the Muslim world suffered from their own increasing back-sliding from their original high spiritual, moral and ethical pedestal. The \u2018Allamah took great pains to elaborate these causes in the hope that the Muslim society would use them as the springboard for their revival. Though these thoughts are spread over this entire works in the form of poems and individual verses three long poems in Bang-i-Dara have detailed them. These poems are the present one, \u201cSham\u2018a-o-Sha\u2018ir \u201d (The Candle and the Poet) and \u201cJawab-i-Shakwah\u201d (The Response to the Complaint), also in the same book. The present poem is a complaint to God in which \u2018Allamah Iqbal describes the sacrifices made by the Muslim Ummah in the cause of Islam, as well as their achievements. He pleads that in view of this the present deplorable condition of the Muslim world is unfair. He prays for Divine help to Muslims to improve their condition and get back their old status of prestige and glory. | Though several reputed thinkers and literateurs in the Indian sub-continent and other parts of the Muslim world had earlier attempted to probe into the causes and suggest remedial and corrective measures for the poor condition of the Muslim Ummah \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s two poems, viz Shakwah (The Complaint) and Jawab-i-Shakwah (The Response to the Complaint) stand out as the ones with exquisite literary grandeur and beauty. For this reason it was but natural for them to have special appeal to all Muslims in general and to the Muslims of the Indian sub-continent in particular. The poems did have this effect and made \u2018Allamah Iqbal near and dear to the hearts of the Muslims everywhere. These poems have been translated and molded into music in Urdu as well as other languages including Arabic and important European languages.\n\nWhy should I be destructive and remain reckless of betterment? | Think not of the future, remain occupied in today\u2019s problems?\nShould I hear nightingale\u2019s wails, and remain completely silent? | O companion!

The first one is contained in the first three verses and states that Love of God and His \u2018ibadah are inseparable from each other. `Ibadah is meaningless without His Love and the culmination of love is His real \u2018Ibadah (in the board sense). This is supported by the Holy Qur\u2019an of which six references have been selected. The whole of Surah 55, (Al Rahman) is full of one of the most beautiful literary pieces in which the signs of God in the Afaq are enumerated on the basis of which appeal is made to Man to Love and worship Him in the broad sense. The opening verses of Surahs 57, 59 and 61 command all creation to sing His Praises as an expression of their Love for Him. Similarly the opening verses of Surahs 62 and 64 state that al creation does in fact sing His praises as an expression of their ardent Love for Him. For more details of `ibadah.\n\nO moon!

      "full_text": "Rama, Ramachandra, is a legendary hero of the Hindu period of Indian history. His father was Dashratha who was the king of Ayodhiyah. He had three wives, of which Rama\u2019s mother was Kausalyah. The king exiled Rama for fourteen years to placate his other wife Kaikeyah and gave the throne to her son Bharat. Rama and his wife Sata obeyed the father\u2019s command and went into exile. During this period they roamed about the length and breadth of the Indian sub-continent and faced the ignominy of the abduction of Sata by Ravana who was a demon and ruled Lanka (now Sri Lanka). Rama fought for a long time against Ravana and ultimately succeeded in freeing Sata from him. After this they returned to Ayodhiyah and Rama was crowned king there. | This story is related by Valmaka, an Indian ascetic and poet of the fifth century B.C. He has eulogized Rama and Sata in his well known book in Sanskrit verse, known as Ramayana. This book, is part of the Hindu mythology. Valmika in this book has deified Rama into being the seventh incarnation of Vishnu whom Hindus regard as the god of grace and who forms part of the trinity of Hindu mythology, comprised of Brahamah (the Creator), Vishnu (the preserver) and Shava (the destroyer). The belief in the divinity of Rama was stated again by another Hindu poet named Tulsa Das (1532-1623) who wrote a simpler version of Ramayana, also in verse in 1575 in the then vernacular of Sanskrit, known as Hindi. | It is interesting to know that recently a historical commission appointed by the Government of India, in connection with the controversy whether the Babra Mosque in Ayodhiyah is really on the site of Rama\u2019s temple, has reported that there is no evidence that any man with the name of Rama ever lived in Ayodhiyah. The whole story is a myth created by the Ramayana of Valmaka and perpetuated by that of Tulsa Das. | Irrespective of this mythology \u2018Allamah Iqbal considers him as a famous man of Indian folk lore and praises him in this poem for that reason.\n\nOverflowing with the wine of Truth is the cup of India | All philosophers of the Western world have acknowledged India\nIt is the result of the elegant thinking of Indians | That higher than the sky is the position of India\nThis country has had many people of angelic disposition | On whose account world renowned is the name of India\nIndia is proud of the existence of Rama | Spiritual people consider him prelate of India\nThis alone is the miracle of this light of righteousness | That brighter than world\u2019s morning is the evening of India\nHe was expert in sword craft, was unique in bravery | Was matchless in piety and in the enthusiasm of love",

He was a trained soldier and earned the rank of a hero in Turkish history. His hard and bold military actions before, during and after World War I in the pursuit of protecting Turkey against the political intrigues as well as military onslaughts of the Western Allied Powers has earned a high place for him. However, after assuming political power after World War I, he abolished the Uthmaniya Khilafah in 1924, which exposed him to the anger of sincere Muslims all over the world who wanted to restore Islam to its pristine purity and grandeur after freeing the Muslim world from the clutches of Western Powers. \u2018Allamah Iqbal is one of this group of Muslims whose heart was grieved by the abolition of the Khilafah. Though the political and economic weakness of the Uthmania Khilafah, before, during and after the First World War cannot be denied, nor can the existence of corruption and inefficiency which led to that state of affairs. However , the Institution of Khilafah, in spite of its defects and shortcomings, was providing some degree of unity to the Muslim Ummah and was giving it the colour of a super-national political entity. This was lost by its abolition and the Muslim Ummah was divided into secular nation states whose evils we are seeing now. By this act Mustafa Kamal also tarnished his own image among the Muslim Ummah, a name which he had earned by extremely heroic deeds in defense of the Khilafah before, during and after World War I. So by abolition of the Khilafah , Mustafa Kamal deprived Islam and the Muslim Ummah of its rightful place of being the only super-national entity, as well as tarnished his own image in Muslim History. It is in this sense that \u2018Allamah Iqbal calls him \u201cimprudent Turk\u201d.",

      "full_text": "This is one of the series of long poems starting with poem 88, Shakwah (The Complaint). As explained in the introduction to that poem this series of poems deals with the rise, glory, achievements, decline and fall of the Muslim world. As stated earlier this subject was the one dearest to \u2018Allamah Iqbal and perhaps the raison d`etre of his works. In Shakwah the emphasis is on the services and achievements of the early Muslims in the cause of Islam and God. In the present poem the field has widened. The poem is an allegory describing a conversation with the candle. The poet himself represents an average Muslim leader, spiritual as well as secular. He starts with asking the candle the reason for its effectiveness in creating its love in the moth and the one for his own ineptitude in the field of influencing his own circle. The candle states the reason to be its own sincerity and the lack of it in the leaders. The main cause of the present deplorable condition of the Muslim Ummah is its distancing itself from the Holy Qur\u2019an and Islamic values. The recent efforts at reform are inadequate as well as too late. However, like other works of \u2018Allamah Iqbal, in this poem also the state of his frustration is not permanent. The candle gives the message of hope and points out that the Muslim Ummah is waking up to its responsibilities and is starting to face its adversaries with the help of the Holy Qur\u2019an. The great potential of the Ummah is described in detail and the poem ends with firm hope and promise of success for the Ummah and defeat of our enemies and their value system. The climax is reached in the last verse.\n\nThe Poet\nLast night I said to the candle of my desolate house | \u201cYour hair gets combed by the wings of the moth\nIn the world I am like the lamp of the wilderness\u2019 tulip | I am neither in an assembly\u2019s lot, nor in a house\u2019 fortune\nSince a long time I am also burning my breath like you | Though I am circling the flame no moth has hit its wing\nMany an effulgence is crammed in my life of unfulfilled desires | Not a single loving heart rises in this assembly\nFrom where have you acquired this world-illuminating fire? | You have infused the love of Kalam in the poor insect\u201d !\nThe Candle\n\u201cThe blow of breath which gives me the message of death | By the same blow of breath your lip is melodious\nI am alight because burning is built into my nature | You are alight so that the moths may have the love of yours\nI am weeping because a flood gushes forth from my heart | You shed dew so that garden\u2019s assembly may sing praises yours\nMy morning is adorned with the roses from my night\u2019s toil | Your tomorrow is unaware of the today of yours\nThough you are lightened your are devoid of the inner heat | Like the lamp of the wilderness\u2019 tulip is the flame of yours\nJust think if cup-bearer\u2019s title is appropriate for you | Assembly is thirsty and the wine-measure is empty of yours\nYour ways are different, the law of the Millat is different | Your mirror has been disgraced by the ugly appearance of yours\nWith the Ka\u2018bah by your side you are temple\u2019s lover | How rebellious is the irresponsible love of yours\nThat Qais be produced in your assembly is not possible | Your wilderness is straitened, without Lailah is the litter of yours\nO brilliant pearl ! O the one reared in the wave\u2019s lap | Unacquainted with the taste of storms is the ocean of yours\nWhy are you singing now? your garden is in disorder! | Your singing is out of place, your music is out of season\nThose who were anxious for the Spectacle have departed | Your coming now with general Sighting\u2019s promise matters little\nThose old ardent lovers of wine are gone from the assembly | O cub-bearer ! Your coming now in assembly with strong wine in the cup matters little\nAh ! When the rose garden\u2019s organization has already got disorganized | If the flower got the message of spring breeze matters little\nThe lover\u2019s condition was worth seeing at the night\u2019s end | The Beloved\u2019s arrival early in the morning matters little\nExtinguished is the flame which was every moth\u2019s objective | If some pursuer of perfect love came now it matters little\nThe flowers do not care, you may or may not sing | The caravan is callous, the bell may or may not ring\nIf devoid of love\u2019s warmth you remained even as assembly\u2019s candle | Your moths also unacquainted with this taste remained\nIf you could string them together on the thread of Love | Then why did the beads of your rosary scattered remain?\nGone is the courageous Love, gone is the sublime thinking | In your assembly neither the insane nor the sages remain\nGone is that burning of Love, gone is that heart\u2019s pathos | What good it is if the moths round the candle did remain?\nVery well, the cup-bearer you may be, whom will you serve wine | Now neither those wine-drinkers nor those taverns did remain\nToday a broken decanter is crying for the cup-bearer | Whose goblets in circulation till yesterday did remain\nToday are silent those Love-cherishing expanses | Where Lailah and her lovers dancing did remain\nHow disappointing ! The caravan\u2019s wealth is gone | The feeling of loss from caravan\u2019s heart is gone\nWith whose activities the wilderness was once flourishing | Their cities are wiped out, habitations desolate have became\nThe prayers which established the grandeur of Tawhad | Those prayers offerings to Brahman in India have become\nIn this world ever-lasting comfort on laws\u2019 observance depends | To the ocean wave freedoms prelude to lamentation have become\nThe Manifestation Itself was longing for whose eyes | Those eyes despaired of Aiman\u2019s light have become\nThousands of nightingales were flying about in the rose-garden | What happened to them that they confined to the nests have become ?\nIn the celestial expanse whose lightning power was panoramic | Those lightning\u2019s satiated with the barn\u2019s sides have become\nWhy should the blood letting eye ingratiated to the rose garden be ? | With continuous tears the eyes fully satiated with embers have become\nHowever, the grief\u2019s night gives the message of \u2018Eid\u2019s morning | In the darkness of the night the ray of hope has appeared\nGlad tidings, O cup-bearer of the tavern of Hijaz | After ages your rinds have regained consciousness\nWealth of self-respect was the price for other\u2019s wine | Now your shop is again full of calls for the carousal\nAbout to break is the magic of India\u2019s white faced masters | Again the Sulaima\u2019s eye is the harbinger of clamor\u2019s message\nThere is clamor again for cup-bearer to bring the home-made wine | As the heart\u2019s uproars have been silenced by the West\u2019s wine\nSing because this is not the time for silence | The dawn\u2019s sky is shouldering the sun like decanter\nBurn in sympathy with others and also make others burn | Listen if you can, a bright Hadath has been conveyed to you\nAncestors have said that poetry is a part of prophethood | Yes, convey to the Millat the glad tidings of the Messenger Angel !\nAwaken the eye with the promise of the Beloved\u2019s Sight | Bring the heart to life with the warmth of speech\u2019s skill\nYour love for indulgence became a robber of courage | You were an ocean in wilderness, in garden a brook you became\nWhen you stood firm in your purity, you had the nation also | Caravan of fragrance after leaving the rose scattered became\nThe life of the drop has lessons of the secrets of life | Sometimes pearl, sometimes dew, sometimes tear it became\nObtain it from somewhere it is a great wealth | What good is life if the heart unaware of bosom became\nYour honor depended upon the organization of the Millat | When this organization departed, disgraced world wide you became\nThe individual is firm by nation\u2019s coherence, otherwise nothing | The wave is only in the ocean, and outside it is nothing\nKeep the love concealed in your heart\u2019s veil still | That is do not disgrace your wine like the decanter\nPitch your tent in the Valley of Sinai like Kalam | Make the Truth\u2019s flame destroyer of home\u2019s comfort\nThe candle should also know the result of atrocities | Make the moth\u2019s ashes restorer of the morning\nIf you are self-respecting be not obliged to the cup-bearer | In the ocean\u2019s midst turn the goblet up side down like the bubble\nNo joy remains in the old mountains and wilderness | Your love is new, you should create new wilderness\nIf the destiny has destroyed you completely | From downfall make a new rod like the seed\nYes !@ Build your nest again on the same old branch | Make the rose garden\u2019s residents martyrs of the song of intoxication\nIn this garden be the nightingale\u2019s follower or rose\u2019 pupil | Either be all complaint or do not produce any music\nWhy are you silent in the garden like dew\u2019s retreat | Open your lips, you are the music of the world\u2019s harp!\nBecome somewhat acquainted with your own reality O farmer! | The grain, the cultivation, the rain, as well as the produce you are\nAh !

      "full_text": "This short poem, full of pathos, is the sincere out-pouring of \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s heart-felt grief. It is an allegory of an audience with the Holy Prophet S.A.W. It is usual with \u2018Allamah Iqbal, in common with Khawajah Altaf Hussain Hala to present his feelings to the Holy Prophet (S.A.W) at critical times and to request him for supplication to God to alleviate the situation. This poem was written in 1913 for the immediate problem of the invasion of Libya by Italy, as is indicated by the last verse. However, it also reflects the \u2018Allamah\u2019s feelings on the deplorable condition of the Muslim Ummah throughout the world in the first two decades of the present century. At that time the imperialist countries of Europe were ransacking the whole world, pillaging the natural resources of the defenseless nations of all countries outside Europe. Not stopping there they obliterated the cultures and religions of the vanquished people in the misplaced enthusiasm of making them \u201ccivilized\u201d, and protecting them from hell-fire. Their strategy consisted of forcing as well as enticing them into the fold of Christianity, among other things, by their doctrine of vicarious atonement of S.\u2018Isa A.S. In case of the Muslim countries there was an added reason for enmity in their attempt to wreak vengeance of their repeated defeats at the hands of Muslims in the Wars of Crusades over a long period of time. | tarabilus (Tripoli) is a port in Tripolitania, which is the northwestern province of the present day Libya, extending from the Mediterranean to the Sahara. It was invaded and conquered by Italy in 1911-12, when it was a part of the Khilafah. | The machinations of the European imperialists against the Islamic Ummah have been documented in many books which can be consulted for details. | The bereavement of Muslims was caused not only by the conquest of Muslim countries by Europeans but by the atrocities during and after such conquests. All colonial countries have witnessed them. The following few quotations show the seriousness of the matter: | (Shakab Arsalan (1869-1946) was a Druze Muslim, who fought constantly against European powers throughout his life. - Author.) | \u201cHis (Arsalan\u2019s) commitment was most evident in his reaction to the Italian invasion of Libya in October 1911, when he went to the battle-front himself. This response although more direct than others was not unrepresentative of reverberations which the Italian invasion produced throughout the Arab Islam. In Tunisia there were open anti-Italian riots; in Egypt a strong wave of pro-Uthmaniyah sentiment swept across all levels of society. Fear of the systematic European campaign against Islam was heightened by the fact that French forces had occupied Fez in the spring of 1911, initiating the final stages in the process that added Morocco to the international system of protectorates.\u201d (p. 19) | The so-called \u201cInternational system of protectorates\u201d was the establishment of suzerainty of European powers. (Author) | \u201cIn this earlier phase, which is our concern here, Arsalan was never more outspoken than in his condemnation of General Graziani\u2019s brutalization of the Cryenaican population. He wrote to Rida that when he learnt of the deportations, executions, tortures and sexual humiliations inflicted on the civilian population of Jabal al- Akhzar \u201cI let my pen loose on those dogs\u201d. In article after article, he enumerated the horrors committed by the Italian forces and condemned Fascist Italy as being beyond the pale of humankind......... He told his readers that when the Italian forces captured the oasis of Kufrah, they turned the Great Sanusi Zawiyyah into a tavern where they drank toasts to the extermination of Muslims of Tripoli ; and they threw the Holy Qur\u2019an\u2019s beneath their horses\u2019 hooves and then used them to light the fires of their cooking pots.\u201d (p. 100). | \u201cThe Italian abuse of Islam and the population of Libya meant more than the atrocities themselves. The real objective of the Fascist government was the extermination of Islam from the entire region and replacing it with Christian colonists. Arsalan saw the Fascists in Libya acting as Ferdinand and Isabella had done toward the Moor of Spain. (pp. 100-101) | In reality one does not have to read any books to appreciate the serious nature of the situation with reference to the relationships of the Western world and their henchmen with the Islamic world. One has only to look around in the present day world to witness the heart rending atrocities of the Western nations and their proxies against the Islamic world. First sight observation is worth a million books.\n\nWhen I felt this ignoble strife of the world grievous | Packing up my goods and chattel I departed from the world\nThough I did pass life within limits of morning and evening | I never got acquainted with the old system of the world\nThe angles took me to the assembly of the Holy Prophet | They took me to the audience of the symbol of God\u2019s Mercy\nThe Holy Prophet said \u201c O nightingale of the garden of Hijaz! | Each flower-bud of yours is melted with your music\u2019s warmth\nYour heart is always ecstatic with the wine-cup of God\u2019s proximity | Your supplication is the envy of prostrations in Divine Love\nIn your flight from the lowly world to the celestial world | The angels taught you the elegance of the flight\nYou have come like fragrance out of the world\u2019s garden | With what gift for me have come you?\u201d\n\u201cSire ! Satisfaction on the earth is not available | The life I am searching for is not available\nThousands of tulips and roses exist in the garden of existence | The flower-bud with the fragrance of fidelity is not available\nBut I have brought a lover\u2019s wine-glass as an offering | Whatever is in this even in paradise is not available\nGlistens your Ummah\u2019s honor in this | Blood of Tripoli\u2019s martyrs is in this\u201d",

      "full_text": "This long poem is part of the series of long poems in which \u2018Allamah Iqbal has discussed the rise and fall of the Muslim Ummah and has analyzed its causes, shown his bereavement as well as has offered its cure and has given the message of hope. A few of these poems have been mentioned in the Introduction to Poem 88 \u201cShakwah\u201d (The Complaint). | The causes of the fall of the Muslim Ummah can be grouped into two classes, viz. the machinations of the Western world and the shortcomings of the Muslim themselves.The present poem is complementary to Shakwah. In Shakwah the \u2018Allamah complains to God for the deplorable condition of the Muslim world and society and prays for help. In the present poem he relays the response given by God to Muslims. The details of the response are generally restricted to the Muslims\u2019 own faults. These faults can be summarized as follows: | 1. Muslims have distanced themselves from the Holy Qur\u2019an, Islamic values and the norms of their ancestors, and have adopted Western norms in thought and deeds. | 2. They have given up Islamic learning. | 3. Insincere religious and political leadership has appeared. | 4. Muslims have lost the Love of God and the zeal for Tawhad. | 5.They have fallen into traditionalism | 6. They have given up activism and struggle in the cause of God and have adopted asceticism and monasticism. | 7. They have lost the urge for struggle in the cause of Islam. | 8. Muslim society is riddled with dissensions | 9.

However, focusing attention on Iran in this verse is not for exigencies of poetry.

Though Britain and Russia had guaranteed Iran\u2019s independence in 1834 Britain forced Iran\u2019s withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1885. The discovery of oil in 1901 increased Western interference in the Iran\u2019s affairs. In 1907 Britain and Russia agreed to divide Iran into two zones of influence. An army officer Raza Khan mounted a coup de`etat and became dictator in 1921, assuming the title of Raza Shah Pahlava in 1925. All these circumstances bereaved \u2018Allamah Iqbal on account of which he included Iran in this verse. However, he has used it as a conviction of hope for Islam and Muslims to reduce their frustration at the world affairs vis- a-vis Muslims."

It compares the intoxication of the material kind, which may be caused by intoxicants or the arrogance of material wealth, with the ecstasy of the wine of m\u2018arifah which gives additional sanity in the form of insight into spiritual truths to the one who drinks it. The Muslim Ummah is addressed as the cup-bearer. In the last verse the Ummah is admonished to wake up from its slumber of several centuries to face the problems of the coming age, which is expressed by the metaphor of dawn. The metaphors of night and dawn in this verse also represent the dark age in the history of the Muslim Ummah, which is about to end, and the new world order in which the Muslim Ummah will be the leader of mankind and will be called upon to shoulder various responsibilities. This thought is expanded in the poem 145 \u201ctulu-i-Islam\u201d (The Dawn of Islam), which is coming later in the book.\n\nEveryone knows how to throw down people with intoxicants | The fun is to convert the intoxicated one to sanity, O cup-bearer\nThose who were the old wine-drinkers are gradually departing | Bring the water of immortality from somewhere, O cup-bearer\nYour whole night has passed in tumult and clamor | The dawn is close remember God, O cup-bearer!",

      "full_text": "The Ruhalahs were an Afghan tribe who had inhabited an area about 10,000 square miles north east of Delhi. They had acquired much influence and political power by the fourth decade of the eighteenth century. At that time they were a formidable force and proved very effective in breaking the back bone of the Marhatas in the third battle of Panipat, near Delhi in 1761. This battle was fought mainly by the Afghan leader, Ahmad Shah Abdala, helped by Najab al-Daulah, the Prime Minister of the Mughal Emperor with some help from the Ruhalahs. This watershed event occurred under the able and timely political move of the great \u2018alim and sufi of Delhi, Shah Wala Allah. Notwithstanding these services to Islam Ruhalahs helped themselves as well to the spoils of the chaos resulting from the decline and break up of the Mughal Empire. This poem relates an anecdote of the attack of Ghulam Qadir Ruhalah on the Red Fort, Delhi in which he blinded the Mughal Emperor and entered into the conversation described in the poem. The last line of the poem is also its lesson, which is that in luxury and indolence a nation loses the will to strive for a virile and self-respecting life. As \u2018Allamah Iqbal says: | (202) What was unacceptable gradually became accepted | In slavery nation\u2019s conscience becomes spoiled\n\nHow cruel, tyrant and vindictive the Ruhalah was | He blinded the Mughal Emperor with the point of his dagger\nThe tyrant ordered members of the royal household to dance | This tyranny was no less than the Judgment Day\u2019s signal\nFor the delicate ladies of the royal household it was | Utterly impossible to comply with this shameless order\nAh !

This is a very great consolation and a beacon of light for those engaged in the struggle for the Truth.

Cf. | (205) The life not fired with the desire for revolution death is | The struggle for revolution essence for nations\u2019 life is. | It must also be understood that the purpose of adopting this theme was to infuse a new spirit in the dead body of the Muslim Ummah during the period of the lowest ebb in its history.\n\nStruggle has continued from eternity till the present day | Between the lamp of Mus\u00e8afa and the spark of Bu Lahab\nLife is flame-tempered, high-minded and fervent | It\u2019s nature is resolving difficulty, bearing cruelty\nFrom the evening\u2019s quietude till the morning\u2019s song | There are many a stage of the midnight wailing!\nStruggle exists between the heat and cold, throbbing and shaping | From the dark dust to the polished glass of Halab !\nThe phenomena of making and breaking, squeezing, heating and distilling | Exist between the drop of spring rain and the heat of the grape wine!\nNations live by this continuous struggle alone | This alone is the secret of the Arab nation\u2019s struggle !\n\u201cThe tavern-keepers making wine from the grape | Break the stars and construct the sun\u201d",

      "full_text": "This poem was written in Europe at the time of the death of \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s mother. It is not only an expression of his grief on this sad incident but is also an expression of the philosophy of life and death and the grief created by them. It expands the thoughts expressed in Poem No. 82 Falsafah-i-Gham (The Philosophy of Grief). In spite of realizing that everything in the universe is subject to the Will and Command of God the news of his mother\u2019s death was too hard to bear. He reminisces his whole life and recapitulates some memorable events of his domestic life. He explains with several examples , that death is a transitory phase in existence and is not designed to annihilate a person. The last verse of stanza 8 is important. By comparing man with stars he presents the Islamic concept of man\u2019s superiority over the rest of creation. The last two verses of stanza 10 are important. Though time mitigates all grief the loss of his mother has caused him so much grief that time cannot reduce it. The poem ends in a supplication to God for his mother.\n\nEvery particle of the universe is a prisoner of destiny | Prudence is a cover for helplessness and compulsion\nThe sky, the sun and the moon all are helpless | The fast moving stars are compelled to moving\nBreaking is the end of flower bud\u2019s pitcher in the garden | The garden\u2019s verdure and flowers are also compelled to grow\nIt may be nightingale\u2019s song or conscience\u2019 silent call | Everything is chained in the same universal chain!\nWhen this secret of helplessness becomes evident to the eye | The turbulent flood of tears in the heart dries up\nThe dance of pleasure and grief does not remain in the human heart | The song remains but the pleasure of treble and bass does not remain\nKnowledge and wisdom are robbers of tears and sighs\u2019 wealth | That is the intelligent heart is a piece of diamond!\nThough the dew\u2019s freshness does not exist in my garden | My eye is not enriched with the red tears\nAh! I am aware of the secret of human afflictions | But my nature\u2019s orchestra is unaware of complaint\u2019s song\nThe story of vicissitudes of time does not come on my lips | My heart is not astonished, not laughing, not crying\nBut O messenger, your picture is one of constant wailing | Ah! this is the contradiction of my firm wisdom!\nLife\u2019s foundation becomes lasting with overflowing wailing | The hard hearted Intellect is embarrassed with the knowledge of pathos\nMy mirror is bright with the wave of sighs\u2019 smoke | My skirt is full with the treasure of tears\nThe miracle of your picture has surprised me | Which has completely changed the flight of time\nAs if it brought the past and present together | It acquainted me again with the age of infancy\nWhen that feeble soul was being nurtured by your side | Whose tongue was not adequately familiar with talking\nAnd whose linguistic spice is now the subject of conversation | The pearls of whose jewel-shedding eyes are priceless\nThe learning\u2019s serious discourses, the shrewdness of old age | The dignity of worldly honors, the pride of young age\nWe descend from the positions of dignity in life | We descend as a simple child in the lap of the mother\nWe are laughing informally, we are free from care | We are once more living in the same lost paradise\nAh! Who will now be waiting for me in the homeland? | Who will become restless by not getting my letter?\nI will come to your grave carrying this lament | To whose thoughts will I come in the midnight prayers?\nWith your up-bringing I became fortunate like stars | The house of my ancestors became a source of pride\nYour life was written in gold letters in the existence\u2019 book | Your life was a full lesson of secular and religious education\nYour love remained in my service for your whole life | When I was able to serve you, you did not survive\nThat youth who equals the slender cypress in stature | Who became more fortunate in serving you than me\nThat constant companion of mine in the business of life | That picture of yours in love, that source of my strength\nHe is crying like a helpless infant for you | He is crying with impatience from morning till evening\nThe love whose seed you planted in our life\u2019s field | By the grief of separation that love became more firm\nAh! This world, this mourning place for the young and old! | In what a strange ever-changing prison man is imprisoned!\nHow difficult it is to live!

The restless mercury, the sky brightening stars | The heat of these sparks is obligated to the night\nTheir antiquity is bewildering to the Intellect | The history of the human race is a mere moment for them\nThen this Man whose vision is directed to the celestial world | Who is more immaculate in his goals than qudsis\nWho is lighted up like a candle in the assembly of Nature | In the expanse of whose nature celestial world is a mere dot\nWhose ignorance is restless to know the Truth | Whose nail is the plectrum to the harp of existence\nIs this flame inferior than the sky\u2019s sparks even? | Is our sun less precious than the stars even?\nThe eye of flower\u2019s seed is awake even under the soil | How restless for growth and development the seed is\nThe flame of life which is concealed in this grain | Is under compulsion for self-assertion and growth\nEven with the grave\u2019s cold it cannot become dispirited | Even by being buried under soil it cannot become cold!\nBecoming a flower, it comes out of its grave | That is it gets the robe of life from its death\nGrave is the organizer of its scattered powers | Which is throwing its rope-ladder round sky\u2019s neck\nDeath is the name of the renewal of life\u2019s taste | Behind the veil of sleep it is a message of awakening\nThe one accustomed to flight is not afraid of flight! | Death in this garden is nothing but readying for flight!\nPeople say that the pain of death is incurable | Separation\u2019s wound is cured with time\u2019s salve\nBut the heart where the grief of the dead ones is living | Is free from the loop of the chain of morning and evening\nMourning\u2019s wailing does not stop with the spell of time | Time is no salve for the wound of separation\u2019s sword\nWhen some sudden calamity befalls us | Tears come out of the eyes constantly\nThe heart becomes accustomed to wailing and complaint | The heart\u2019s blood drips from the tearful eyes\nThough Man is deprived of the power of patience | This sub-conscious feeling always exists in his nature\nThe essence of Man does not become annihilated | He disappears from sight but is not annihilated\nThe baggage of life is dust with the flame of grief | This fire is cooled with this subtle feeling\u2019s water\nAh! This control of wailing is not negligence\u2019 silence | This consolation is awareness, it is not forgetfulness!\nWhen the dawn manifests itself from the east | It washes away the night\u2019s stain from the world\u2019s skirt\nIt clothes the melancholy tulip in red garb | It makes the silent bird intoxicated with music\nThe song is freed from the nightingale\u2019s breast | The morning breeze is so full of hundreds of tunes\nThose who in rose beds, mountains and brooks were sleeping | At long last in the morning the bride of life are embracing\nIf the law of life is that every night dawn be | Why the end of Man\u2019s grave should not his dawn be\nThe net of my silvery imagination is universal | In which I have imprisoned your remembrance!\nThe affliction stricken heart is filled with your memory | As in the Ka\u2019bah the expanse is filled with supplications!\nThe sequence of Divine commands which is called life | Its manifestations are covering myriad of unstable worlds\nThe ways of every stage of life are different | Hereafter also is a marshaling place of life!\nNothing is available there to the death\u2019s field | But the climate is favorable for action\u2019s seed\nThe light of nature is not imprisoned in body\u2019s darkness | The expanse of the human thought is not so narrow\nYour life was brighter than even the moon | Your journey was better than even that of the morning star\nMay your grave be bright like the dawn\u2019s mansion | May this dusty bed-chamber of yours be light-filled!\nMay the sky be spraying dew on your grave! | May the freshly grown grass be guarding this house!",

        "Khizar: This hemistich alludes to the tradition of Khizar A.S. and Sikandar. Khizar was endowed with two gifts from God, viz. mercy and knowledge from His own Presence. The second hemistich is relevant to the parable alluded to here. This gift entitled him to interpret the inner meaning and mystery of events and creations of God. Though the Holy Qur\u2019an does not say so in Muslim literature Khizar is credited with the knowledge of the stream, of the water of immortality, drinking which would confer immortality on any living object, including Man. This tradition could be based on Greek writings which have influenced Muslim thought to a very great extent. Sikandar was one of the persons who requested Khizar to lead him to this stream. The identity of Sikandar is also shrouded in mystery. The Holy Qur\u2019an relates the parable of a powerful and righteous king Dhul Qarnain ( TheTwo- horned One) in Surah 18:83-101. This king is identified with three kings, viz (I) Alexander the Great of Greece (356-323 B.C.); (ii) an ancient Persian king and (iii) a prehistoric Himyarite king. For a discussion of the comparative merits of these three hypotheses see the Holy Qur\u2019an 18:83-101. However, the lesson of the parable which \u2018Allamah Iqbal wants to convey is not very dependent on the identity of Sikandar. When Khizar was very much pressed by Sikandar for leading him to the stream of immortality he did so. When they reached there they found hundreds of thousands of living beings, including men, who had taken the water and had not died. They had grown old, decrepit and devoid of feelings. The moral of the story is that the normal cycle of the birth and death as designed by God is the best scheme of things for human beings as well as other living things. The moral of the story also is that the value of the water of immortality, which persists till today in folk lore, lies in its being unavailable even to a king like Sikandar. Similarly, the value of a self-respecting person lies in his being out of reach of kings and other materialistic elite of the world."

      "full_text": "Out of the many differences between Islam and Hinduism the two most important ones in the view of \u2018Allamah Iqbal are (I) Tawhad-i-Ilah (Unity of God) and (ii) Tawhad-i-Insaniyat (Unity of mankind). These two religions are diametrically opposed to each other in these two respects. In the \u2018Allamah\u2019s view the second emanates from the first and is more important. Hinduism is an amalgam of traditions and rituals, of devotional and philosophical systems, built over the past 4500 years, arising from the indigenous Dravidian cults and successive invasions from outside, especially those of Aryans (2000-1500 B.C.). The oldest existing religious book of Hindus is the Vedas (Ca. 500 B.C.). In the context of this poem the Hindu society is traditionally divided into four classes or castes. viz. (i) Brahman (priests) (ii) Khashtrya (noble warriors) (iii) Vaishya (merchants and farmers) and (iv) Shudra (workers). The last mentioned are also untouchables. This abominable system of dividing humanity into four separate and completely immiscible classes is against the teachings of Islam (The Holy Qur\u2019an 49:13) and this forms the subject matter of this poem. Its evils are described in the poem. However, the \u2018Allamah also pays tribute to two other religious reformers of the Indian sub-continent, viz. Gautam Buddha and Nanak. The first protest against the caste system came from Siddharta Gautam Buddha. Buddha\u2019s rejection of the caste system and declaration that all humanity is one is dealt with in this poem. The second reform came in the 16th century in the form of Sikhism founded by Guru Nanak. This religion was a movement for reformation of Hinduism under the strong influence of Islam. Renunciation of the caste system is among the strongest pillars of the Sikh religion (See the last two verses of the poem).\n\nThe nation did not care for the message of Gautam at all | The value of its own single pearl it did not appreciate at all\nAh!

Bilal R.A. \u201cAlexander\u201d is shown to be Roman. Firstly, \u201cAlexander\u201d is a Greek name and no Roman emperor by this name is known. Secondly, reference to Porus and Dara in the third verse shows that Alexander of Greece is meant. The word \u201cRuma\u201d has been used because Alexander was also the ruler of Asia Minor, which was later a part of the Eastern or the Byzantine wing of the Roman Empire. Also, both Rome and Greece were formidable powers in ancient history of Europe. See Explanatory Notes.\n\nA righteous Western writer has written | Who was highly respected among the literateur\n\u201cAsia was the marshaling place of Sikandar of Rome | His status was More elegant than even the sky\nHistory attests that in combat with the Romans | The claims of Porus and Dara were vain\nAt this emperor with the myriad-man army | The blue sky was looking with amazement\nToday nobody knows him in Asia | Even the historian does not recognize him\nBut Bilal, that humble person with Negroid origin | Whose nature had been brightened by the Prophethood\u2019s Light\nThe call whose custodian the breast of Bilal since eternity became | Subservient to which call emperors as well as the indigent became!\nWhich brings amity between the black and the red | By which the poor and the rich are placed together\nThat heart-melting song is fresh till the present age | Which the old sky\u2019s ear has been hearing for centuries\u201d\nIqbal ! This general blessing is due to whose love? | The Roman has perished, the Negro is immortal!",

      "full_text": "Mullah Muhammad Malik Quma (d. 1615) came from Qum, Iran to Ahmad Nagar in South India in 1549 where he was patronized by Murtaza Ni\u00efam, Nizam Shah I. Later he moved to Bijapur and lived under the patronage of Ibraham \u2018Adil Shah. He was one of the eminent Persian poets of his time. In addition to the inclusion of one verse in the last two verses of this poem \u2018Allamah Iqbal has alluded to this verse in Rumuz-i-Bekhudi also. Mullah \u2018Abd al-Qadir Badayuni also has praised this verse in his book Muntakhib al-Tawarakh. | This poem is the exposition of \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s views on Western education. Though the educational philosophy of \u2018Allamah Iqbal is a vast subject and much has been written about it, its essence is that education should produce Khuda and the desire as well as the ability to struggle in the cause of God and Truth. Though the subject cannot be explained in all its dimensions in this translation some comprehension is essential to do justice to the poem. Western education may be beneficial to the Western people and may have been necessary for the material advancement of Indian Muslims in their special circumstances created by the British rule in the sub-continent it is detrimental to the ideals and goals of Islam as set out in the Holy Qur\u2019an. Establishment of the \u201cKingdom of God on earth\u201d in the form of the super-national Islamic State, with all its details and accompaniments, is the purpose of the mission of the Holy Prophet (S.A.W.), which was entrusted by him to his Ummah at the time of the last pilgrimage. The Holy Qur\u2019an is replete with commands to this effect, reference to which has been made in previous poems, for example the introduction to Poem 84. Taranah-i-Milla (The National Anthem of Muslims). When viewed against this background Western education not only falls short of the needs of Muslims but is contrary to them. Being secular and materialistic it is in fact detrimental to Muslims\u2019 aspirations and objectives. A small sample of quotations from some other poems of \u2018Allamah Iqbal is given below to give some indication of his views on the subject: | (209) The school and tavern teach only not to be | Learn to be that you may be and want to be | (210) O God ! My complaints are against the schools\u2019 lords | They are teaching mud-slinging to falcon\u2019s fledglings | (211) I would not get that knowledge and wisdom for a piece of straw | Which acquaints not the ghaza with the battle-field | It appears necessary to explain here that \u2018Allamah Iqbal was not opposed to all Western education. When Sir Saiyyid Ahmad Khan and his colleagues started their campaign to persuade Indian sub-continent\u2019s Muslims to acquire Western education they had scientific and technical education foremost in mind. \u2018Allamah Iqbal had the same opinion and has repeatedly emphasized the importance of science and technology for material betterment. Cf. | (212) West\u2019s strength is in science and technology | With help of this same fire its lamp is lighted | The deleterious effects of Western education have resulted mainly from the philosophy of science and from humanities. The former has created a disbelief in the existence of a non-tangible spiritual universe, and has created belief in the mechanistic and a-rational concept of creation and operation of the material universe. This is opposed to the Qur\u2019anic concept according to which the material universe has been created by God instead of coming into existence by accident. It has been created with a purpose and not whimsically or in sport. It also states that the material universe in not eternal and will also end in its present form. The Holy Qur\u2019an is replete with this message which emphasizes its importance, e.g. 3:191; 15:85; 16:3; 21:16-17; 39:5; 44:39; 45:22; and 46:73. The Holy Qur\u2019an also teaches us that God has not rested or retired after creating the universe but is actively directing its affairs. Denial of this concept deprives Man of faith in the life Hereafter and the accountability for one\u2019s deeds on earth. This deprivation leads to the cardinal vice of materialism according to which this world and life in it is the be-all and end-all of existence. This inculcates jealousy and greed for acquiring material wealth and arrogance when it has been acquired. This triple-headed monster of jealousy, greed and arrogance brings out a plethora of vices out of the Pandora\u2019s box. One has to look around himself in the present day world to appreciate the truth of this. The whole of the modern world has been plunged into the vortex of a moral and spiritual storm which has destroyed all humane values. The cure lies in reverting to the spiritual values taught by the Holy Qur\u2019an. | The following small sample is presented to reflect \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s thought about the deprivation of the Western education from the higher concepts of existence: | (213) They conceal the higher motives from the human eye | Put the soul to sleep and awaken the material eye! | (214) The West dark with the smoke of machines is | This Valley of Aiman unwortly of Effulgence is\n\nThe preceptor\u2019s teaching was, \u201cO foolish Muslim! | \u201cNecessary preparations are incumbent on the traveler\nThe world\u2019s ways have changed, such changes have come that | Those who were invaluable once are not even saleable now\nThat bright flame of yours from which darkness escaped | Now is reduced to a spark, less bright than stars\nCease to be the Invisible\u2019s Lover, be the visible\u2019s lover | Now influence of the visible God is triumphant over nations\nIn this garden success for your efforts is not possible | Your snare is worn out and the fast-flying bird is clever\nIn this age education is the cure for nations\u2019 maladies | Education is like a lancet for the diseased blood\u201d\nBy the leader\u2019s suggestions love of education developed in me | Obeying the command of Khizar is incumbent on the wanderer of the wilderness\nBut the discerning eye should see my misfortune | \u201cWent to pull thorn from foot, the litter disappeared from the sight",

The significance of this night is two fold. First, it was the occasion when the secrets of the spiritual part of the celestial world were opened to a human being. This shows the elegant position of Man in comparison with other creatures of God. Secondly, the Holy Prophet (S.A.W.) was the only person in the history of mankind and that of divine revelation to whom these secrets were visually shown. The first fact is expressed by \u2018Allamah Iqbal in another verse, which says: | (216) I have learnt from the Holy Prophet\u2019s Ascension to the celestial world | That the world of Man transcends the celestial world | The second one shows that the disclosure of spiritual secrets of the celestial world completed the process of their revelation and obviated the need for subsequent prophets. This is another proof in support of the finality of the Prophethood with the Holy Prophet (S.A.W.).\n\nThis call of the evening star is coming from the sky | \u201cThis is the night before which the dawn prostrates\n\u201cFor courage the \u2018Arsh-i-Baran is only a pace away\u201d | The Mi\u2018raj\u2019s night is saying this to the Muslim",

      "full_text": "\u2018Allamah Iqbal, being a genius himself, appreciated greatness wherever he saw it. His appreciation of genius transcends race, nationality and fields of excellence. In the previous pages we have seen some samples of his exuberant praise where it was deserved. In this poem his hero is no less a personality than William Shakespeare (1564-1616). Shakespeare is acknowledged as the greatest English poet and playwright. He was born and brought up at Stratford-upon-Avon. He stayed in London from 1592 to about 1616 where he perfected his art and returned to his home town about the time of his death. Different ages and different scholars of Shakespeare have admired and eulogized different aspects of his genius. However, \u2018Allamah Iqbal in conformity with other modern critics, has been greatly impressed by Shakespeare\u2019s command of language which made him conscious symphonic artist. This feeling is reflected in the poem under study.\n\nTo the dawn\u2019s twilight the river\u2019s graceful flow is a mirror | To the evening\u2019s song the evening\u2019s silence is a mirror\nTo the spring\u2019s beautiful cheek flower petal is a mirror | To the lover of wine the cup\u2019s cavity is mirror\nBeauty is God\u2019s mirror and heart is Beauty\u2019s mirror | To the human heart the beauty of your marks is a mirror\nBy your heaven-embracing thought is the perfection of existence | Was your bright nature the aim of existence?\nWhen the eye searching for your sight sought you | It saw the sun veiled in the brightness of the sun\nYour existence surely remained veiled from the world\u2019s eye | And your eye saw the world completely unveiled\nNature has such a strong desire for guarding secrets | That another confidante like you it will never create!",

It was the biggest and the most fortified stronghold of Jews in the Arabian Peninsula. The Jews, living there in prosperity, were the biggest adversaries of Islam at that time. They were constantly plotting against Islam in collusion with the pagan and hypocrite Arab tribes. This state of affairs could not be tolerated for long and the Holy Prophet (S.A.W) was compelled to invade Khaibar in 629. At that time Khaibar comprised six fortresses, the strongest and safest of which was Qamus, which was headed by Marhab. He was a Jewish hero and was considered to be equivalent to a thousand cavalry men on account of his strength and bravery. This fortress was finally attacked by Muslims under the leadership of S. \u2018Ala (R.A.) after several unsuccessful attempts under other leaders. Marhab made his appearance first, very heavily armed in full armor. He was engaged in battle by S. \u2018Ali (R.A). After a short engagement S.\u2018Ala (R.A.) killed him and the fortress fell.

Also, we learn from the Holy Qur\u2019an that man can have only what he strives for (53:39-42). | This poem was written when the Muslims all over the world generally, and in the Indian sub-continent particularly, were working for the restoration of the Khilafah in Turkey. However, a great part of their effort consisted of approaching the British Government in London and the League of Nations in Geneva for doing justice to Muslims. \u2018Allamah Iqbal tells them in this poem that such efforts would be of no avail. This proved to be true.

      "full_text": "This long poem is an allegory prepared to convey \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s philosophy on several social, economic and political problems facing the world in general and the Muslim world in particular. It is based on an imaginary conversation with S. Khizar A.S. on the model of that described in the Holy Qur\u2019an 18:60-82. The artistic perfection of the poet has made the parallel perfect. S. Musa A.S. was guided through wahy to search for S. Khizar A.S. for obtaining eternal secrets. The Holy Qur\u2019an uses the expression Majma\u2018 al- Bahrain for the meeting of the two, which may mean confluence of two seas or two rivers. The consensus of opinion among exegesists is that this place was the Gulf of Aqabah. However, \u2018Allamah Abu al-A\u2018la Mawduda has expressed the opinion that the meeting place could have been at the junction of the two tributaries of the River Nile, the \u201cBahr-al-Abyaz\u201d (The White Nile) and \u201cBahr-al-Arzaq\u201d (The Blue Nile) in Sudan. Bahr also means a large river which agrees with the word Darya used in this poem. However, irrespective of the meeting place the poem describes the questions posed by \u2018Allamah Iqbal in the first part and the answers he received in subsequent parts. These are clear and self contained in the poem. It is also a commentary on World War I and its influence on the Western as well as the Muslim world.\n\nOne night at the river-bank I was absorbed in contemplation | With a world of restlessness concealed in the heart\u2019s recesses\nThe night was tranquil, air calm, river gently flowing was | My eye was amazed whether the river or a picture of water it was!\nAs the suckling baby falls asleep in the cradle | The restless wave had fallen asleep somewhere else!\nWith the spell of night the birds were confined in nests | The twinkling stars were caught in the moon\u2019s spell!\nSuddenly I saw that the globe-trotting Khizar | Whose old age contained youth\u2019s color like dawn\nWas saying to me \u201cO seeker of the eternal secrets | If the inner eye be open world\u2019s destiny would be unveiled\u201d!\nOn hearing this an uproaring tumult rose in my heart | Being devoted to seeking the Truth I started talking thus\n\u201cO you whose world-encompassing eye sees those storms | Whose tumults are still sleeping quietly in the river\nThe \u201cindigent\u2019s boat\u201d the chaste soul , the \u201corphan\u2019s wall\u201d | Even the knowledge of Musa before you is in amazement\nLeaving habitations you remain wandering in wilderness | No day and night, no yesterday and tomorrow is in your life\nWhat is the secret of life?

        "blood: This refers to the behavior of the Arab countries during and after World War I in staging what is known as \u201cArab Revolt\u201d, and the courageous handling of events by the Turks during and after that War. During the War Arabs sided with the British and undermined the strength of \u2018Uthmaniya Khilafah by waging war and sabotage. This is not only a general reference to all Arabs but also a specific reference to King Faisal I who was made the first king of the Hashimite Kingdom of Iraq by the British as a reward for his betrayal of the\u2018Uthmaniya Khilafah during the War. As he claimed descent from the Holy Prophet (S.A.W) he is referred to as the \u201cHashimite\u201d. \u2018Abd al-\u2018Azaz ibn Sa\u2018ud (1880-1953), in his desire to rule the whole of Arabian Peninsula, managed to get British help. He used this help not only for establishing his own rule throughout the Arabian peninsula by subduing all the tribes, which could only be done after wholesale bloodshed. He also used it for ousting Sharaf Hussain, Sherif of Makkah Mu\u2018a\u00ef\u00efamah (1908-1924). By this stratagem he succeeded in getting control over what is now known as Saudi Arabia, including the custody of the two biggest shrines of the Islamic world in Makkah Mu\u2018\u00ef\u00efamah and Madana Munawwarah. This also could only be achieved after much bloodshed and inestimable damage to the glory of the Holy City and the Ka\u2019bah. The Arab revolt was the most painful event of this war. It established complete British control over the heartland of Islam which continues till now. As the British have now ceased to be a superpower the control has passed to the United States. In contrast with all this, under the leadership of Mus\u00e8afa Kamal Pasha and Enver Pasha, the Turks continued fighting the enemies of Islam, viz. the Greeks and the British who were helping them, even after the official termination of the War. As the Turkish armies were then extremely poor in war material and other requisites this War was very hard on them. This verse alludes to those conditions.",

        "cap: Magician of Alamut- Reference to the Hasan Bin Sabbah (d. 1138 )who was a wizard of his age. He lived in Iran in the eleventh century C.E. He built a fort at Alamut, between Qazwain and Jalan. He furnished it\u2019s interior with the state of the art furnishings and accouterment of comfort and luxury, including the most beautiful girls available. He designated this fort \u201cParadise\u201d, and laid claims to prophethood. He had a body of followers who enticed unwary people in cities with administration of hemp and transported them to the Alamut Fort when they became intoxicated with hemp. On gaining consciousness they found themselves in strange surroundings which were the ultimate in luxury, including \u201choura\u2019s\u201d. When they thus became convinced of being in \u201cparadise\u201d they accepted Hasan Bin Sabbah as their prophet. He had built formidable strength which the State could not subdue with mere force. He was a contemporary of Ghias al-Dan Abu al-Fath Qamar Bin Ibraham al-Khayyam, the famous \u201c\u2018Umar Khayyam\u201d: who was a mathematician, astronomer and poet (ca. 1050-1123). The latter ultimately subdued Hasan Bin Sabbah with better wisdom, based on righteousness instead of wizardry. Later this organization was destroyed by the Mongols about the middle of the 13th century .",

      "full_text": "This is the last of the nine long poems in this book. Its position at about the end of the book and immediately after Khizar-i-Rah is not incidental. Many poems in the book express \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s frustration at the state of affairs in the Muslim world and the Muslim society in it. Khizar-i-Rah is the last such poem . Perusal of these poems creates some degree of frustration in the reader which is only temporary till he reads the next poem. tulu-i-Islam leaves the reader filled with lasting enthusiasm produced by the message of hope contained in it, as he finishes the serious part of the book. | The poem was written in the early 1920s soon after World War I, and deals with the aftermath of that war with respect to the Muslims. Though it deals with the defeat and dismemberment of the `Uthmaniyah Khilafah into small secular nation states and complete subjugation of these states by the Western Christian powers at the end of the war, it brings the good news of hope and encouragement. It consists of nine stanzas, each with a different cadence and covers the following subjects: | 1. The starting point and the leading theme is the reassuring thought that the time has come for re-awakening of the Muslim world and re-assertion of Islamic values. | 2. In order to regain their past glories Muslims must: | (a) Recognize the elevated place of Man in the universe, which can be attained only by acquiring Islamic virtues, and appreciate the unity of mankind, which is above race and color. This is also the essence of the teachings of the Holy Qur\u2019an as has been explained and documented at appropriate places earlier. | (b) Recognize their high destiny as the architect of the new world order. | (c) Review the degeneration of the Muslim world, which has resulted from complaisance and ignoring the message of God in the Holy Qur\u2019an. | (d) Recognize the value of Iman and develop it in their lives. | (e) Work together in the struggle for establishment of a new world order of a united super-national millat instead of unconnected geographical nations. | 3. Attention has been drawn to the ethical degeneration of the Western world and society to show the impropriety and inadequacy of their norms as guidelines for the Muslim world.\n\nThe fading glitter of stars is the signal of a bright dawn | The sun has risen from the horizon, the time of deep stupor is gone!\nLife-blood has started flowing through the dead arteries of the East | This secret is incomprehensible to Sana and Faraba !\nThe storm of the West has made the Muslim into a real Muslim | Only the upheavals of the sea bring the pearl\u2019s beauty to its perfection\nThe Muslim is to be endowed again from the God\u2019s Court with | Turkoman\u2019s dignity , Indian\u2019s intellect , Arab\u2019s eloquence\nIf some slumber is lurking still in the flower buds | \u201cStrike the beat harder if the taste for music is lacking\u201d\nJump restlessly in the garden, in the nest, in bowers | It is impossible to deprive mercury of its restlessness\nWhy should the eye used to chaste things see coat of arms | When it is able to see the valor of the Ghaza\u2019s soul!\nO God, light the candle of Longing in the tulip\u2019s heart | Make every speck of garden\u2019s dust a martyr searching for the Truth\nThe effect of spring showers exists in the Muslim\u2019s tears | Pearls are to be produced again in the ocean of Ibraham\nThe Book of the Muslim nation is being organized again | This Hashimite Branch is going to blossom again!\nThe beloved of Shiraz has won the hearts of Tabriz and Kabul | The zephyr produces its fellow traveler from rose\u2019 fragrance!\nThe avalanche of calamity over Uthmanis is not to be bereaved | As the dawn is produced after destruction of myriad\u2019s of stars!\nInsight into the world is more difficult than the world\u2019s sovereignty | Insight is produced only when the heart melts into blood!\nFor thousands of years narcissus bemoans its lack of luster | The discerning person is produced in the garden with difficulty\nSing O Nightingale so that with your modulations | The falcon\u2019s heart in the pigeon\u2019s frail body be produced\nConcealed within your heart is the secret of life | Relate to the Muslim the traditions of pathos of life\nYou are the potent hand and the word of the Eternal God | O imprudent one!

In view of the collapse and ultimate demise of the communist world this seems to be paradoxical. This is so because we are accustomed to considering only two systems, i.e. capitalism and communism. The Muslim world has been so much frustrated and over-awed by the glitter of the Western world that it has completely forgotten the potential of the Islamic political-economic system. \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s works also give the false impression that he was pro-Communist and anti-capitalist. However, a little thought and deep study of his works would show that his support of communism was only apparent and transient and revealed only his temporary satisfaction in the sense that in his view the advent of communism posed the first threat to the capitalist system. The capitalist-communist fighting gave the Muslims a respite and a golden opportunity to reconstruct their material and spiritual world and eventually be able to deal a final deadly blow to both these systems and establish the Islamic system. He has repeatedly shown his disapproval and unhappiness with the communist system, as he has done with the capitalist system. His forecast contained in this verse has been partially fulfilled in the demise of communism. Now that the Islamic world is waking up from its deep stupor the conflict with the Western world and its systems is inevitable. In this conflict the Islamic system will succeed. However, it will not come as a miracle but will have to be achieved by the Muslim world through their sweat and blood. This latter thought is conveyed in the next two verses.",

This is also believed in a modified form of sufism according to which the real existence is that of God only and the universe is only a figment of human mind. The casual mention of this thought in this ghazal does not mean that \u2018Allamah Iqbal believed in Plato\u2019s philosophy.

      "full_text": "This group of twenty nine poems are sarcasm on the contemporary political-social-economic problems. Many of them were written in the early part of \u2018Allamah Iqbal\u2019s literary career and most of them refer to the affairs of the Indian sub-continent. Hence, there is a good amount of local color in the choice of words and expressions. \u2018Allamah Iqbal is reported to have been of a pleasant and amiable temperament when in social circles and his letters reveal a fair amount of humor. However, his serious views on the matters contained in these humorous poems prevailed over his pleasant nature and in some poems he has not been able to avoid passing into serious discourse. The last poem (147-29) is an example of this.\n\nIn the East principles are changed to religion | But in the West they are changed into machines\nWe do not retain even one of them | There one is changed into three\nThe girls are learning English | The nation prosperity\u2019s way has found\nThe ways of the West are in view | Eastern ways sinful are found\nWhat scenes will this drama produce? | On curtain\u2019s rising this will be found\nThe Shaikh also is not a supporter of women\u2019s seclusion | The college boys unnecessarily suspicious of him became\nHe clearly stated in the sermon yesterday | \u201cFrom whom would women be secluded if men women became\u201d\nO wise man!

Even Mr. Gandhi\u2019s modest suggestion of using the term \u201cHindustana\u201d was rejected by the Hindu members. This happened in spite of the great reverence in which Hindus held Mr. Gandhi.

Outwardly it seems as if the poet is talking about himself, but actually he is singing Hymns in praise of God. This Ghazal excels the succeeding Ghazals in sublimity of thought, uniqueness of execution, style, figures of speech and its rapturous nature. | The poet owns his own non-existence and is conscious that he exists only because of God\u2019s Creative Attribute. He is grateful to God for having blessed him with the boundless Passion of Love for Him, which lends wings to his poesy and he can find access to the precincts of the Absolute Being. He is a true lover of God and is not contented, like others, to realise His Essence through His Attributes. Though he is fully aware that Houris and Angels, being creatures of light, are aery, yet he can catch them in the lassoo of his imagination. His sharp and piercing glances can ruffle the moulds in which He manifests Himself, but sometimes the doubts - and conflicts that smoulder in his breast make him miss the mark. God by creating man, who is the image of God on earth, has divulged the mystery that lay hid in the womb of Nature. | Note 2: Mr. Naeem Siddiqui did not translate this ode.

O how sad! | The Muslim is a heap of ashes, nothing more.\nO Saki, serve me that old wine again, | Let that old cup go round once more.\nLend me the wings of Love and make me fly. | Turn my dust to fireflies that flit about.\nFree young men\u2019s minds from slavery, | And make them mentors of the old.\nThe millat\u2019s tree is green thanks to your sap: | You are its body\u2019s breath.\nGive it the strength to vibrate and to throb; | Lend it the heart of Murtaza, the fervour of Siddiq.\nDrive that old arrow through its heart | Which will revive desire in it.\nBlest be the stars of Your heavens; blest be | Those who spend their nights praying to You.\nEndow the young with fervent souls; | Grant them my vision and my love.\nI am a boat in a whirlpool, stuck in one place. | Rescue me and grant me mobility.\nTell me about the mysteries of life and death, | For Your eye spans the universe.\nThe sleeplessness if my tear\u2010shedding eyes; | The restless yearnings hidden in my heart;\nThe prayerfulness of my cries at midnight; | My melting into tears in solitude and company;\nMy aspirations, longings and desires; | My hopes and quests;\nMy mind that mirrors the times | A field for thought\u2019s gazelles to roam\nMy heart, which is a battlefield of life, | Where legions of doubt war with faith\u2014\nO Saki, these are all my wealth; | Possessing them, I am rich in my poverty.\nDistribute all these riches in my caravan, | And let them come to some good use.\nIn constant motion is the sea of life. | All things display life\u2019s volatility.\nIt is life that puts bodies forth, | Just as a whiff of smoke becomes a flame.\nUnpleasant to it is the company | Of matter, but it likes to see its striving to improve itself.\nIt is fixed, yet in motion, | straining at the leash to get free of the elements.\nA unity imprisoned in diversity, | It is unique in every form and shape.\nThis world, this sex\u2010dimensioned idol\u2010house, | This Somnat is all of its fashioning.\nIt is not its way to repeat itself: | You are not I, I am not you.\nWith you and me and others it has formed | Assemblies, but is solitary in their midst.\nIt shines in lightning, in the stars, | In silver, gold and mercury.\nIts is the wilderness, its are the trees, | Its are the roses, its are the thorns.\nIt pulverises mountains with its might, | And captures Gabriel and houris in its noose.\nThere is a silver\u2010grey, brave falcon here, | Its talons covered with the blood of partridges,\nAnd over there, far from its nest, | A pigeon helplessly aflutter in a snare.\nStability is an illusion of eyes, | For every atom in the world pulsates with change.\nThe caravan of life does not halt anywhere, | For every moment life renews itself.\nDo you think life is great mystery? | No, it is only a desire to soar aloft.\nIt has seen many ups and downs, | But likes to travel rather than to reach the goal;\nFor travelling is life\u2019s outfit: it | Is real, while rest is appearance, nothing more.\nLife loves to tie up knots and then unravel them. | Its pleasure lies in throbbing and in fluttering\nWhen it found itself face to face with death, | It learned that it was hard to ward it off.\nSo it descended to this world, where retribution is the law, | And lay in wait for death.\nBecause of its love of duality, It sorted all things out in pairs, | And then arose, host after host, From mountains and from wilderness.\nIt was a branch from which flowers kept | Shedding and bursting forth afresh.\nThe ignorant think that life\u2019s impress is | Ephemeral, but it fades only to emerge anew.\nExtremely fleet\u2010footed, It reaches its goal instantly. | From time\u2019s beginning to its end is but one moment\u2019s way for it.\nTime, chain of days and nights, is nothing but | A name for breathing in and breathing out.\nWhat is this whiff of air called breath? A sword, | and selfhood is that sword\u2019s sharp edge.\nWhat is the self? Life\u2019s inner mystery, | The universe\u2019s waking up.\nThe self, drunk with display, is also fond | Of solitude;\u2014an ocean in a drop.\nIt shines in light and darkness both; | Displayed in individuals, yet free from them.\nBehind it is eternity without Beginning, | and before it is Eternity without an end; It is unlimited both ways.\nSwept on by the waves of time\u2019s stream, | And at the mercy of their buffeting,\nIt yet changes the course of its quest constantly, | Renewing its way of looking at things.\nFor it huge rocks are light as air: | It smashes mountains into shifting sand.\nBoth its beginning and its end are journeying, | For constant motion is its being\u2019s law.\nIt is a ray of light in the moon and a spark in stone. | It dwells In colours, but is colourless itself.\nIt has nothing to do with more or less, | With light and low, with fore and aft.\nSince time\u2019s beginning it was struggling to emerge, | And finally emerged in the dust that is man.\nIt is in your heart that the Self has its abode, | As the sky is reflected in the pupil of the eye.\nTo one who treasures his self, | bread won at the cost of self\u2010respect is gall.\nHe values only bread, | he gains with head held high.\nAbjure the pomp and might of a Mahmud; | Preserve your self, do not be an Ayaz.\nWorth offering is only that prostration which | Makes all others forbidden acts.\nThis world, this riot of colours and of sounds, | Which is under the sway of death,\nThis idol\u2010house of eye and ear, | In which to live is but to eat and drink,\nIs nothing but the Self\u2019s initial stage. | O traveller, it is not your final goal.\nThe fire that is you has not come, Out of this heap of dust. | You have not come out of this world; It has come out of you.\nSmash up this mountainous blockade, | Go further on and break out of this magic ring of time and space.\nGod\u2019s lion is the self; | Its quarry are both earth and sky.\nThere are a hundred worlds still to appear, | For Being\u2019s mind has not drained of its creative capabilities.\nAll latent worlds are waiting for releasing blows | From your dynamic action and exuberant thought.\nIt is the purpose of the revolution of the spheres | That your selfhood should be revealed to you.\nYou are the conqueror of this world Of good and evil. | How can I tell you The whole of your long history?\nWords are but a strait\u2010jacket for reality: | Reality is a mirror, and speech, The coating that makes it opaque.\nBreath\u2019s candle is alight within my breast, | But my power of utterance cries halt.\nShould I fly even a hairbreadth too high, | The blaze of glory would burn up my wings.",

In this poem, Allama is trying to portray to his Ummah how we are becoming victim of Westernization in the name of globalization.

The genuine writings of Aristotle. however, were not accessible to them. They studied translations of books passing under his name, which were the work of Neoplatonists, so that what they believed to be Aristotelian doctrine was in fact the philosophy of Plotinus. Proelus, and the later Neoplatonic school. Indirectly, therefore, Plato has profoundly influenced the intellectual and spiritual development of Islam and may be called, if not the father of Mohammedan mysticism, at any rate its presiding genius.\n\nPLATO, the prime ascetic and sage. | Was one of that ancient flock of sheep.\nHis Pegasus went astray in the darkness of idealism | And dropped its shoe amidst the rocks of actuality.\nHe was so fascinated by the invisible | That he made hand, eye, and ear of no account.\n\"To die,\" said he, \"is the secret of Life: | The candle is glorified by being put out.\"\nHe dominates our thinking, | His cup sends us to sleep and takes the sensible world away from us.\nHe is a sheep in man's clothing, | The soul of the Sufi bows to his authority.\nHe soared with his intellect to the highest heaven | And called the world of phenomena a myth.\n'Twas his -work to dissolve the structure of Life' | And cut the bough of Life's fair tree asunder.\nThe thought of Plato regarded loss as profit, | His philosophy declared that being is not-being.\nHe natures drowsed and created a dream | His mind's eye created a mirage.\nSince he was without any taste for action, | His soul was enraptured by the nonexistent.\nHe disbelieved in the material universe | And became the creator of invisible Ideas.\nSweet is the world of phenomena to be living spirit, | Dear is the world of Ideas to the dead spirit:\nIts gazelles have no grave of movement, | Its partridges are denied the pleasure of walking daintily.\nIts dewdrops are unable to quiver, | Its birds have no breath in their breasts,\nIts seed does not desire to grow, | Its moths do not know how to flutter.\nOur recluse had no remedy but flight: | He could not endure the noise of this world.\nHe set his heart on the glow of a quenched flame | And depicted a word steeped in opium.\nHe spread his wings towards the sky | And never came down to his nest again.\nHis fantasy is sunk in the jar of heaven: | I know not whether it is the dregs or brick of the wine-jar.\nThe peoples were poisoned by his intoxication: | He slumbered and took no delight in deeds.",

DIVINE VICEGERENCY\nIf thou canst rule thy camel, thou wilt rule the world. | And wear on thine head the crown of Solomon.\nThou wilt be the glory of the world whilst the world lasts, | And thou wilt reign in the kingdom incorruptible.\n'Tin sweet to be God's vicegerent in the world | And -exercise sway over the elements.\nGod's vicegerent is as the soul of the universe, | His being is the shadow of the Greatest Name.\nHe knows the mysteries of part and whole, | He executes the command of Allah in the world.\nWhen he pitches his tent in the wide I world. | He rolls up this ancient carpet\nHis genius abounds with life and desires to manifest itself: | He will bring another world into existence.\nA hundred worlds like this world of parts and wholes | Spring up, like roses, from the seed of his imagination.\nHe makes every raw nature ripe, | He puts the idols out of the sanctuary.\nHeart-strings give forth music at his touch. | He wakes and sleeps for God alone.\nHe teaches age the melody of youth | And endows every thing with the radiance of youth.\nTo the human race he brings both a glad message and a warning, | He comes both as a soldier and as a marshal and prince.\nHe is the final cause of \"God taught Adam the names of all things,\" | He is the inmost sense of \"Glory to Him that transported His servant by night.\"\nHis white hand is strengthened by the staff. | His knowledge is twined with the power of a perfect man.\nWhen that bold- cavalier seizes the reins, | The steed of Time gallops faster.\nHis awful mien makes the Red Sea dry, | He leads lsrael out of Egypt.\nAt his cry, \"Arise,\" the dead spirits | Rise in their bodily tomb, like pines in the field.\nHis person is an atonement for all the world, | By his grandeur the world is saved.\nHis protecting shadow makes the mote familiar with the sun, | His rich substance makes precious all that exists,\nHe bestows life by his miraculous actions, | He renovates old ways of life.\nSplendid visions rise from the print of his foot. | Many a Moses is entranced by his Sinai.\nHe gives a new explanation of Life, | A new interpretation of this dream.\nHis hidden life is being Life's mystery. | The unheard music of Life's harp.\nNature travels in blood for generations. | To compose the harmony of his personality.\nOur handful of earth has reach the zenith, | For that champion will come forth from this dust\nThere sleeps amidst the ashes, of our To-day | The flame of a world consuming morrow.\nOur bed enfolds a garden of roses, | Our eyes are bright with to-morrow's dawn.\nAppear, O rider of Destiny! | Appear, O light of the dark realm of Change\nIllumine the scene of existence. | Dwell in the blackness of our eyes!\nSilence the noise of the nations, | Imparadise our ears with thy music!\nArise and tune the harp of brotherhood, | Give us back the cup of the wine of love !\nBring once more days of peace to the world, | Give a message of peace to them that seek battle !\nMankind are the cornfield and thou the harvest, | Thou art the goal of Life's caravan.\nThe leaves are scattered by Autumn's fury | Oh, do thou pass over our gardens as the Spring!\nReceive from our downcast brows | The homage of little children and of young men and old!\nIt is to thee that we owe our dignity | And silently undergo the pains of life.",

Or Leviathan\u2019s dread swarm; | Rend its breast and, billow-wise. Swelling into tumult, rise!\nOut of leaden sleep, Out of slumber deep | Arise! Out of slumber deep. Arise!\nListen to this subtlety. That reveals all mystery: | Empire is the body\u2019s dust; Spirit, true Religion\u2019s trust;\nBody lives and spirit lives. By the life their union gives. | Lance in hand, and sword at thighs, Cloaked, and with thy prayer mat, rise!\nOut of leaden sleep, Out of slumber deep | Arise! Out of slumber deep. Arise!\nThou art true and worshipful. Guardian of eternal Rule, | Thou the left hand and the right. Of the World-possessor\u2019s might.\nShackled slave of earthy race, Thou art Time, and thou art Space: | Wine of faith that fear defies. Drink, and from doubt\u2019s prison rise!\nOut of leaden sleep, Out of slumber deep | Arise! Out of slumber deep. Arise!\nAgainst Europe I protest, And the attraction of the West: | Woe for Europe and her charm, Swift to capture and disarm!\nEurope\u2019s hordes with flame and fire. Desolate the world entire; | Architect of Sanctuaries, Earth awaits rebuilding; rise\nOut of leaden sleep, Out of slumber deep | Arise! Out of slumber deep. Arise",

How strange! | Our separation is separation-in-union.\nSeparation gives to this dust (i.e. man) an insight, | It gives the weight of a mountain to a straw.\nSeparation is a token of love; | It agrees with the nature of lovers.\nIf we are alive, it is due to this affliction (of separation), | And if we are immortal, it is due to it.\nWhat is \"I\" and \"He\"? It is a divine mystery | \"I\" and \"He\" are a witness to our immortality.\nThe light of the Essence is everywhere, hidden and apparent ; | To live in company is real life.\nLove does not acquire insight without company, | And without company, it does not become self-conscious.\nIn our assembly, there are divine manifestations, behold! | The world is non-existent and He is existent, behold.\nDoors and walls, cities, towns and streets are not there, | For here there is nothing existent except we and He.\nSometimes He makes Himself a stranger to us, | Sometimes He plays upon us as upon a musical instrument.\nSometimes we fashion His idol out of stone, | Sometimes we prostrate before Him without having seen Him.\nSometimes we tear every veil of Nature, | And boldly see His beautiful face.\nWhat fancy has this handful of dust? | It is due to this fancy that his inner self is illumined.\nWhat a nice fancy that he bewails in separation | And yet he grows and develops through it.\nThis separation developed in him such a spiritual insight, | That he turned his dusk into a dawn.\nHe made the ego subject to affliction: | Thus turned the ancient grief into an ever-living joy.\nHe got strings of pearls from the tears of his eyes | From the tree of bewailing he got sweet fruit.\nTo press the ego tightly to the bosom | Is to turn death into everlasting life.\nWhat is Love? It is to tie all the different stages in a knot. | What is Love?

| Rise up, let us break together against the shore.\nOur child, that is to say, yon ancient river | fills with its roar valley and mountains and meadow;\ncontinually it smites the rocks on its path | until it uproots the fabric of the mountains.\nThat youth who seized cities, deserts and plains | took his nurture from the milk of a hundred mothers;\nits majesty strikes terror into mortal hearts; | all this is from us, not from any other.\nTo live in the bounds of the shore is a sin; | our shore is but a stone in our path.\nTo accommodate oneself to the shore is eternal death, | even though you roll in the sea morning and evening;\nlife is to leap amidst mountain and desert | happy is the wave that has transgressed the shore!\nYou who have read the lines on the brow of Life, | you who have given to the East the tumult of Life,\nyou who have a sigh that consumes the heart, | stirring you to restlessness, and us still more,\nfrom you the birds in the meadow learned their threnody, | in your tears the grasses make ablution;\nout of your genius the field of roses blossomed, | out of your hope many souls are filled with hope.\nYour cry is a bell urging the caravans; | why then do you despair of the dwellers in the Vale?\nTheir hearts are not dead in their breasts, | their embers are not extinguished under the ice;\nwait till you see, without the sound of the Trumpet, | a nation rising out of the dust of the tomb.\nDo not grieve then, visionary; | breathe out that sigh consuming all, dry and moist alike;\nmany cities beneath the turquoise heaven | have been consumed by the flame of a dervish heart.\nDominion is frailer than a bubble | and can be destroyed by a single. breath.\nThe destinies of nations have been shaped by a song, | by a song nations are destroyed and rebuilt.\nThough your lancet has pierced men's hearts, | none has perceived you as you truly are;\nyour melody springs from a poet's song, | but what you utter transcends poesy.\nStir up a new tumult in Paradise, | strike up an intoxicating air in Paradise!\nZinda- Rud\nHabituate yourself to the dervish wine and quaff it continuously; | when you become riper, hurl yourself at the dominion of Jamshid.\nThey said, \"This world of ours-does it agree with you?\" | I said, \"It does not agree\". They said, \"Then break it to pieces\".\nIn the taverns I have seen there is not one worthy adversary; | grapple with Rustam-i Dastan, have done with Magian boys!\nTulip of the wilderness, you cannot burn alone; | strike this heart- enflaming brand upon the breast of man;\nYou are the ardour of his bosom, the heat of his blood | do you not believe me? Then tear apart the flesh of the world.\nIs reason your lamp? Set it on the path to shine; | or is love your cup?

Where is the world? | Why is there a distance between me and Thee?\nSay, why am I in the bonds of destiny? | Why dost Thou die not, whilst I die?\nThe Voice of Beauty\nYou have been in the world dimensionate, | and any contained therein, therein dies.\nIf you seek life, advance your selfhood, | drown the world's dimensions in your self.\nYou shall then behold who am and who you are | how you died in the world, and how you lived.\nZinda-Rud\nAccept the excuses of this ignorant man; | remove the veil from the face of destiny.\nI have seen the revolution of Russia and Germany, | I have seen the tumult raging in Moslemdom,\nI have seen the contrivings of West and East | prevent the destinies of West and East.\nEpiphany of the Divine Majesty\nSuddenly I beheld my world, | that earth and heaven of mine,\nI saw it drowned in a light of dawn; | I saw it crimson as a jujube-tree:\nout of the epiphanies which broke in my soul | I fell drunk with ecstasy, like Moses.\nThat light revealed every secret veiled | and snatched the power of speech from my tongue.\nOut of the deep heart of the inscrutable world | an ardent, flaming melody broke forth.\nAbandon the East, be not spellbound by the West, | for all this ancient and new is not worth one barleycorn.\nThat signet-ring which you gambled away to Ahriman | should not be pledged even to trusty Gabriel.\nLife, that ornament of society, is guardian of itself; | you who are of the caravan, travel alone, yet go with all!\nYou have come forth brighter than the all-illumining sun; | so live, that you may irradiate every mote.\nAlexander, Darius, Qubad and Khusrau have departed | like a blade of grass fallen in the path of the wind.\nSo slender is your cup that the tavern has been put to shame; | seize a tumbler, and drink wisely, and so be gone!",

It is based on the famous Qur\u2019anic verse describing the Prophet\u2019s ascension :\u2018 \u2018Glory to Him Who carried His Servant by night from the Sacred Mosque . - .\u201c (xvii. 1). The Qur\u2019an uses words like \u2018abdina, \u2018abdan, \u2018ibadan, etc., all signifying God\u2019s creatures, as, for instance, xix. 93: There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes to the Beneficent as a servant (\u2018abdan).\u201d the \u2018abduhu (His slave) is used here by Iqbal in the sense of Perfect Man, especially the Holy Prophet.",
        "life.: With regard to the character of the Perfect Man, expressed in this verse, Iqbal says: \u201cMaulana Rumi has very beautifully expressed this idea (of man\u2019s absorption of God into himself]. The Prophet, when a little boy, was once lost in the desert. His nurse Halima was almost beside herself with grief but while roaming the desert in search of the boy she heard a voice saying [Mathnavi, iv, 976]: \u2018Do not grieve, he will not be lost to thee; Nay, the whole world will be lost in him.\u2019 The true individual cannot be last in the world ; it is the world that is lost in him\u201d (quoted in Nicholson, Tr., Secrets of the Self, Intro., pp. xix-xx, footnote).",
        "heart: (ll. 466-68). Here two kinds of death are mentioned : one, the death of ordinary people, the other, the death of strong personalities. Rumi has also described (Mathnavi, iii, 3435) these two kinds of death: [That one in whose eyes death is destruction, he takes hold of God\u2019s command: do not cast yourself into destruction; that one to whom death is the opening of the gate, he is addressed by God as: vie ye with one another in hastening.] Iqbal believes that if life had been led without pursuit of ideals and the state of tension has not bean maintained, then death would lead to dissolution of personality. To one who has led a life of fruitful activity death is only a kind of passage to another world (Reconstruction, pp. 19-20; Nicholson, Tr., Secrets of the Self, Intro., p. xxiv).",
        "water.: Heart, dil. In Muslim literature, the word dill or qalb stands for the source of spiritual experience, ilham, inspiration. The idea was developed by Ghazali in Ihya\u2019. It is based on the Qur\u2019anic verse: \u201cThen He made him (man) complete and breathed into him of His spirit, and gave you ears and hearts. . .\u201c (xxxii. 93).",
        "kettle,: on this verse, Iqbal says: \u201cThe \u2018heart\u2019 is a kind of inner intuition or insight which, in the beautiful words of Rumi, feeds on the rays of the sun and brings us into contact with aspects of Reality other than those open to sense-perception. It is, according to the Qur\u2019an, something which sees,\u2019 and its reports, if properly interpreted, are never false\u201d (Reconstruction, pp. 15-16).",
        "assembly,: Reference may be to Moses\u2019s striking of a rock and the gushing forth of water. See the Qur\u2019an, ii. 60."
