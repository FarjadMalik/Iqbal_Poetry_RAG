{"poem_id":"001_112","book_title":"Bang-e-Dara","section_title":"Poems of Period - 1908-30","description":"Rama, Ramachandra, is a legendary hero of the Hindu period of Indian history. His father was Dashratha who was the king of Ayodhiyah. He had three wives, of which Rama\u2019s mother was Kausalyah. The king exiled Rama for fourteen years to placate his other wife Kaikeyah and gave the throne to her son Bharat. Rama and his wife Sata obeyed the father\u2019s command and went into exile. During this period they roamed about the length and breadth of the Indian sub-continent and faced the ignominy of the abduction of Sata by Ravana who was a demon and ruled Lanka (now Sri Lanka). Rama fought for a long time against Ravana and ultimately succeeded in freeing Sata from him. After this they returned to Ayodhiyah and Rama was crowned king there. | This story is related by Valmaka, an Indian ascetic and poet of the fifth century B.C. He has eulogized Rama and Sata in his well known book in Sanskrit verse, known as Ramayana. This book, is part of the Hindu mythology. Valmika in this book has deified Rama into being the seventh incarnation of Vishnu whom Hindus regard as the god of grace and who forms part of the trinity of Hindu mythology, comprised of Brahamah (the Creator), Vishnu (the preserver) and Shava (the destroyer).
