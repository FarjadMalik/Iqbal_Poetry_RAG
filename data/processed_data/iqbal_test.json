This Haram is without Zam-zam. | His songs bring about the destruction of mankind.\nIt removes from the heart all ambitions and gives grief instead, | It pours poison in the cup of Jamshed.\nHearken brother! grief is of two kinds, | Lighten your lamp of reason with our flame\nOne kind of grief is that consumes man; | The other kind of grief is that eats up all other griefs.\nThe second kind of grief that is our companion | Frees life from all kinds of grief.\nIt involves the tumults of the east and west | It is like a vast ocean in which all beings are submerged.\nWhen it takes its abode in the heart, | It turns the heart into a vast shoreless sea.\nServitude is but ignorance of the secret of life | Its song is empty of the second kind of grief.\nI don't say that its notes are wrong | Such bewailings become only a widow.\nSong should be violent like a storm | So that it may remove from the heart the clouds of grief.\nIt should be nourished on ecstasy\u2014 | A fire dissolved in the blood of the heart.\nIt is possible to develop flame out of its wetness, | And to make silence a part of it.\nDo you know that in music there is a stage | Where speech develops \"without words\"?\nA brilliant song is Nature's lamp | Its meaning imparts form to it.\nI don't know whence comes the essence of meaning | We are aware of its form which is apparent.\nIf the song is shorne of meaning, it is dead | Its \"heat\" emanates from a dead fire.\nThe secret of meaning was unveiled by Rumi | On, whose threshold my thought prostrates\n\"Meaning is that transports you aloft | And makes you independent of the apparent form;\nMeaning is not that makes you deaf and blind | And makes a man enamoured of mere form all the more.\nOur musician did not enjoy the beauty of meaning; | He attached himself to form and ignored meaning altogether.","input":"Generate a poem in the style of Allama Iqbal from the book 'Zabur-e-Ajam' best described as ''"}

The deplorable condition of the Muslim countries and society and the lack of amicable solution of the Hindu-Muslim problem of the Indian sub-continent which was delaying its independence.

To school pleasure and passion; | this is the affair of the soul, not the affair of lip and palate.\nFrom it arise the flames that burn the breast, | it does not accord with your temperament yet.\nMartyr of the delicate beauty of reason, | I will tell you of the revelations of reason!\nWhat is the Koran? Sentence of death for the master-man, | succour for the slave without food and destitute.\nLook not for good from the money-grubbing manikin | You will not attain piety, until you expend.\nWhat pray is born of usury? Tumults! | No one knows the pleasure of 'a good loan'.\nUsury darkens the soul, hardens the heart like a stone, | makes man a ravening beast, without fangs and claws.\nIt is lawful to draw one's sustenance from the soil | this is man's 'enjoyment', the property of God.\nThe believer is the trustee, God is the possessor; | whatever you see other than God is perishing.\nGod's banner has been beaten down by kings, | their entry has reduced townships to misery.\nOur bread and water are of one table; | the progeny of Adam are as a single soul.\nWhen the Koran's design descended into this world | it shattered the images of priest and pope;\nI speak openly what is hidden in my heart | this is not a book, it is something other!\nWhen it has entered the soul, the soul is transformed; | when the soul has been transformed, the world is changed.\nLike God, it is at once hidden and manifest, | living and enduring, yes, and speaking.\nIn it are the destinies of East and West | realise then the lightning-like swiftness of thought!\nIt told the Moslem, \"Put Your life in your hands; | give whatever you possess beyond your needs.\"\nYou have created a new law and order; | consider it a little in the light of the Koran\nand you will understand life's heights and depths, | you will comprehend the destiny of life.\nOur assembly is without wine and cupbearer, | yet the melodies of the Koran's instrument are immortal;\nif our plectrum now strikes without effect, | Heaven houses thousands of excellent strummers.\nGod's remembrance requires not nations, | it transcends the bounds of time and space.\nGod's remembrance is apart from the remembrance of every remembrancer | what need has it of Greek or Syrian?\nIf God should remove it from us | He can if He will transfer it to another people.\nI have seen the blind conformity and opinionatedness of Moslems | and every moment my soul trembles in my body;\nI fear for the day when it shall be denied to them. | and its fire shall be kindled in quite other hearts.\nThe Sage of Rum bids Zinda-Rud intone a song | The Sage of Rum, that man filled wholly with ecstasy and passion,\nI know what effect these words had on his soul; | he drew from his breast a heart-rending sigh,\nhis tears ran redder than the blood of martyrs. | He, whose arrows pierced only the hearts of heroes,\nturned his gaze upon Afghani, and spoke: | \"The heart must throb with blood like the twilight,\nthe hand must be thrust into the saddle-straps of God; | hope moves the soul to flow like a running river,\nthe abandonment of hope is eternal death.\" | He looked at me again, and said: Zinda-Rud,\nwith a couplet set all being afire. | Our camel is weary and the load is heavy;\nmore bitter must be the song of the caravaneer. | The proving of holy men is through adversity,\nit is right to make the thirsty yet more athirst. | Like Moses depart from the the River Nile,\nstride out like Abraham towards the fire. | A melody of one who catches the scent of the Beloved","input":"Generate a poem in the style of Allama Iqbal from the book 'Javed Nama' best described as ''"}
