# Iqbal Poetry RAG System

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for exploring and querying the poetry of Allama Iqbal. This project leverages vector search and large language models (LLMs) to answer questions about Iqbal's poetry, providing relevant poem excerpts as context.

---

## ðŸš€ Hugging Face Spaces Ready

This project is ready to be deployed as a [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces). The configuration block above (in YAML) tells Hugging Face how to launch the app:
- **sdk**: Uses Gradio for the web interface.
- **app_file**: Entry point for the app (`app/main.py`).
- **python_version**: Uses Python 3.10.
- **short_description**: Shown in the Space's thumbnail.
- **tags**: For discoverability.

To deploy, simply upload this repository to your Hugging Face account as a new Space.

---

## Features

- **Semantic Search**: Retrieve the most relevant poems for a given question using vector embeddings.
- **LLM-Powered Answers**: Generate answers using a language model, grounded in retrieved poem context.
- **Gradio Interface**: User-friendly web interface powered by [Gradio](https://gradio.app/).
- **Plug-and-Play Dataset**: The poetry dataset is already included in the repository, with all paths set up for immediate use.
- **Configurable**: Easily adjust retrieval thresholds, model settings, and data sources.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management for smoother user experience.
- **(Optional) Feedback Logging**: Log user feedback for continuous improvement.

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (a fast Python package installer, drop-in replacement for pip)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iqbal_poetry_rag.git
cd iqbal_poetry_rag
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

**Just plug and run!**  
The poetry dataset is already included in the repository, and all file paths are set up using relative paths. No additional data preparation is required.

To launch the Gradio app locally:

```bash
python app/main.py
```

This will start a Gradio web interface in your browser, where you can enter your questions about Iqbal's poetry and receive contextually grounded answers.
